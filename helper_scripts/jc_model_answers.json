What is the difference? Many ordinary readers assume that there is a single text for the plays: what Shakespeare wrote. But Shakespeare\\u2019s plays were not published the way modern novels or plays are published today: as a single, authoritative text. In some cases, the plays have come down to us in multiple published versions, represented by various Quartos (Qq) and by the great collection put together by his colleagues in 1623, called the First Folio (F). There are, for example, three very different versions of Hamlet, two of King Lear, Henry V, Romeo and Juliet, and others. Editors choose which version to use as their base text, and then amend that text with words, lines or speech prefixes from the other versions that, in their judgment, make for a better or more accurate text. Other editorial decisions involve choices about whether an unfamiliar word could be understood in light of other writings of the period or whether it should be changed; decisions about words that made it into Shakespeare\\u2019s text by accident through four hundred years of printings and misprinting; and even decisions based on cultural preference and taste. When the Moby\\u2122 Text was created, for example, it was deemed \\u201cimproper\\u201d and \\u201cindecent\\u201d for Miranda to chastise Caliban for having attempted to rape her. (See The Tempest, 1.2: \\u201cAbhorred slave,/Which any print of goodness wilt not take,/Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee\\u2026\\u201d). All Shakespeare editors at the time took the speech away from her and gave it to her father, Prospero. The editors of the Moby\\u2122 Shakespeare produced their text long before scholars fully understood the proper grounds on which to make the thousands of decisions that Shakespeare editors face. The Folger Library Shakespeare Editions, on which the Folger Digital Texts depend, make this editorial process as nearly transparent as is possible, in contrast to older texts, like the Moby\\u2122, which hide editorial interventions. The reader of the Folger Shakespeare knows where the text has been altered because editorial interventions are signaled by square brackets (for example, from Othello: \\u201c If she in chains of magic were not bound, \\u201d), half-square brackets (for example, from Henry V: \\u201cWith blood and sword and fire to win your p , y y right,\\u201d), or angle brackets (for example, from Hamlet: \\u201cO farewell, honest soldier. Who hath relieved/you?\\u201d). At any point in the text, you can hover your cursor over a bracket for more information. Because the Folger Digital Texts are edited in accord with twenty-first century knowledge about Shakespeare\\u2019s texts, the Folger here provides them to readers, scholars, teachers, actors, directors, and students, free of charge, confident of their quality as texts of the plays and pleased to be able to make this contribution to the study and enjoyment of Shakespeare. Synopsis Caesar\\u2019s assassination is just the halfway point of Julius Caesar. The first part of the play leads to his death; the second portrays the consequences. As the action begins, Rome prepares for Caesar\\u2019s triumphal entrance. Brutus, Caesar\\u2019s friend and ally, fears that Caesar will become king, destroying the republic. Cassius and others convince Brutus to join a conspiracy to kill Caesar. On the day of the assassination, Caesar plans to stay home at the urging of his wife, Calphurnia. A conspirator, Decius Brutus, persuades him to go to the Senate with the other conspirators and his friend, Mark Antony. At the Senate, the conspirators stab Caesar to death. Antony uses a funeral oration to turn the citizens of Rome against them. Brutus and Cassius escape as Antony joins forces with Octavius Caesar. Encamped with their armies, Brutus and Cassius quarrel, then agree to march on Antony and Octavius. In the battle which follows, Cassius, misled by erroneous reports of loss, persuades a slave to kill him; Brutus\\u2019s army is defeated. Brutus commits suicide, praised by Antony as \\u201cthe noblest Roman of them all.\\u201d Title: Julius Caesar Author: William Shakespeare Release date: November 1, 1998 [eBook #1522] Most recently updated: September 19, 2025 Language: English Credits: the PG Shakespeare Team, a team of about twenty Project Gutenberg volunteers *** START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK JULIUS CAESAR *** THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR by William Shakespeare Contents ACT-I Scene-I.

You know that you are Brutus that speaks this, Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last. BRUTUS: The name of Cassius honors this corruption, And chastisement doth therefore hide his head. CASSIUS: Chastisement? BRUTUS: Remember March; the ides of March remember. Did not great Julius bleed for justice\\u2019 sake? What villain touched his body that did stab And not for justice? What, shall one of us That struck the foremost man of all this world But for supporting robbers, shall we now Contaminate our fingers with base bribes And sell the mighty space of our large honors For so much trash as may be grasp\\u00e8d thus?

There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats, For I am armed so strong in honesty That they pass by me as the idle wind, Which I respect not. I did send to you For certain sums of gold, which you denied me, For I can raise no money by vile means. By heaven, I had rather coin my heart And drop my blood for drachmas than to wring From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash By any indirection. I did send To you for gold to pay my legions, Which you denied me. Was that done like Cassius? Should I have answered Caius Cassius so? When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous To lock such rascal counters from his friends, Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts; Dash him to pieces! CASSIUS: I denied you not. BRUTUS: You did. CASSIUS: I did not. He was but a fool that brought My answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart. A friend should bear his friend\\u2019s infirmities, But Brutus makes mine greater than they are. BRUTUS: I do not, till you practice them on me. CASSIUS: You love me not. BRUTUS: I do not like your faults. CASSIUS: A friendly eye could never see such faults. BRUTUS: A flatterer\\u2019s would not, though they do appear As huge as high Olympus. CASSIUS: Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come! Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius, For Cassius is aweary of the world\\u2014 Hated by one he loves, braved by his brother, Checked like a bondman, all his faults observed, Set in a notebook, learned and conned by rote To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger, And here my naked breast; within, a heart Dearer than Pluto\\u2019s mine, richer than gold. If that thou be\\u2019st a Roman, take it forth. I that denied thee gold will give my heart. Strike as thou didst at Caesar, for I know When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better Than ever thou lovedst Cassius. BRUTUS: Sheathe your dagger. Be angry when you will, it shall have scope. Do what you will, dishonor shall be humor. O Cassius, you are yok\\u00e8d with a lamb That carries anger as the flint bears fire, Who, much enforc\\u00e8d, shows a hasty spark And straight is cold again. CASSIUS: Hath Cassius lived To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus When grief and blood ill-tempered vexeth him? BRUTUS: When I spoke that, I was ill-tempered too. CASSIUS: Do you confess so much? Give me your hand. BRUTUS: And my heart too. CASSIUS: O Brutus! BRUTUS: What\\u2019s the matter? CASSIUS: Have not you love enough to bear with me When that rash humor which my mother gave me Makes me forgetful? BRUTUS: Yes, Cassius, and from henceforth When you are over-earnest with your Brutus, He\\u2019ll think your mother chides, and leave you so. POET: Let me go in to see the Generals. There is some grudge between \\u2019em; \\u2019tis not meet They be alone. LUCILIUS: You shall not come to them. POET: Nothing but death shall stay me. CASSIUS: How now, what\\u2019s the matter? POET: For shame, you generals, what do you mean? Love and be friends as two such men should be, For I have seen more years, I\\u2019m sure, than ye. CASSIUS: Ha, ha, how vilely doth this cynic rhyme! BRUTUS: Get you hence, sirrah! Saucy fellow, hence! CASSIUS: Bear with him, Brutus. \\u2019Tis his fashion. BRUTUS: I\\u2019ll know his humor when he knows his time. What should the wars do with these jigging fools?\\u2014 Companion, hence! CASSIUS: Away, away, be gone! BRUTUS: Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders Prepare to lodge their companies tonight. CASSIUS: And come yourselves, and bring Messala with you Immediately to us. BRUTUS: Lucius, a bowl of wine. CASSIUS: I did not think you could have been so angry. BRUTUS: O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs. CASSIUS: Of your philosophy you make no use If you give place to accidental evils. BRUTUS: No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead. CASSIUS: Ha? Portia? BRUTUS: She is dead. CASSIUS: How \\u2019scaped I killing when I crossed you so? O insupportable and touching loss! Upon what sickness? BRUTUS: Impatient of my absence, And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony Have made themselves so strong\\u2014for with her death That tidings came\\u2014with this she fell distract And, her attendants absent, swallowed fire. CASSIUS: And died so? BRUTUS: Even so. CASSIUS: O you immortal gods! BRUTUS: Speak no more of her.\\u2014Give me a bowl of wine.\\u2014 In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius. CASSIUS: My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.\\u2014 Fill, Lucius, till the wine o\\u2019erswell the cup; I cannot drink too much of Brutus\\u2019 love. BRUTUS: Come in, Titinius. Welcome, good Messala. Now sit we close about this taper here, And call in question our necessities. CASSIUS: Portia, art thou gone? BRUTUS: No more, I pray you.\\u2014 Messala, I have here receiv\\u00e8d letters That young Octavius and Mark Antony Come down upon us with a mighty power, Bending their expedition toward Philippi. MESSALA: Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor. BRUTUS: With what addition? MESSALA: That by proscription and bills of outlawry, Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus Have put to death an hundred senators. BRUTUS: Therein our letters do not well agree. Mine speak of seventy senators that died By their proscriptions, Cicero being one. CASSIUS: Cicero one? MESSALA: Cicero is dead, And by that order of proscription. Had you your letters from your wife, my lord? BRUTUS: No, Messala. MESSALA: Nor nothing in your letters writ of her? BRUTUS: Nothing, Messala. MESSALA: That methinks is strange. BRUTUS: Why ask you? Hear you aught of her in yours? MESSALA: No, my lord. BRUTUS: Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true. MESSALA: Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell, For certain she is dead, and by strange manner. BRUTUS: Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala. With meditating that she must die once, I have the patience to endure it now. MESSALA: Even so great men great losses should endure. CASSIUS: I have as much of this in art as you, But yet my nature could not bear it so. BRUTUS: Well, to our work alive. What do you think Of marching to Philippi presently? CASSIUS: I do not think it good. BRUTUS: Your reason? CASSIUS: This it is: \\u2019Tis better that the enemy seek us; So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers, Doing himself offense, whilst we, lying still, Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness. BRUTUS: Good reasons must of force give place to better. The people \\u2019twixt Philippi and this ground Do stand but in a forced affection, For they have grudged us contribution. The enemy, marching along by them, By them shall make a fuller number up, Come on refreshed, new-added, and encouraged, From which advantage shall we cut him off If at Philippi we do face him there, These people at our back. CASSIUS: Hear me, good brother\\u2014 BRUTUS: Under your pardon. You must note besides That we have tried the utmost of our friends, Our legions are brim full, our cause is ripe. The enemy increaseth every day; We, at the height, are ready to decline. There is a tide in the affairs of men Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune; Omitted, all the voyage of their life Is bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now afloat, And we must take the current when it serves Or lose our ventures. CASSIUS: Then, with your will, go on; We\\u2019ll along ourselves and meet them at Philippi. BRUTUS: The deep of night is crept upon our talk, And nature must obey necessity, Which we will niggard with a little rest. There is no more to say. CASSIUS: No more. Good night. BRUTUS: Early tomorrow will we rise and hence. BRUTUS: Lucius. BRUTUS: My gown. BRUTUS: Farewell, good Messala.\\u2014 Good night, Titinius.\\u2014Noble, noble Cassius, Good night and good repose. CASSIUS: O my dear brother, This was an ill beginning of the night. Never come such division \\u2019tween our souls! Let it not, Brutus. BRUTUS: Everything is well. CASSIUS: Good night, my lord. BRUTUS: Good night, good brother. TITINIUS/MESSALA: Good night, Lord Brutus. BRUTUS: Farewell, everyone. BRUTUS: Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument? LUCIUS: Here in the tent. BRUTUS: What, thou speak\\u2019st drowsily? Poor knave, I blame thee not; thou art o\\u2019erwatched. Call Claudius and some other of my men; I\\u2019ll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.

And then he offered it the third time. He put it the third time by, and still as he refused it the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopped hands and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked Caesar, for he swooned and fell down at it. And for mine own part, I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air. CASSIUS: But soft, I pray you. What, did Caesar swoon? CASCA: He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was speechless. BRUTUS: \\u2019Tis very like; he hath the falling sickness. CASSIUS: No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness. CASCA: I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and displeased them, as they use to do the players in the theater, I am no true man. BRUTUS: What said he when he came unto himself? CASCA: Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown, he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut. An I had been a man of any occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word, I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so he fell. When he came to himself again, he said if he had done or said anything amiss, he desired their Worships to think it was his infirmity. Three or four wenches where I stood cried \\u201cAlas, good soul!\\u201d and forgave him with all their hearts. But there\\u2019s no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less. BRUTUS: And, after that, he came thus sad away? CASCA: Ay. CASSIUS: Did Cicero say anything? CASCA: Ay, he spoke Greek. CASSIUS: To what effect? CASCA: Nay, an I tell you that, I\\u2019ll ne\\u2019er look you i\\u2019 th\\u2019 face again. But those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads. But for mine own part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarves off Caesar\\u2019s images, are put to silence. Fare you well. There was more foolery yet, if I could remember it. CASSIUS: Will you sup with me tonight, Casca? CASCA: No, I am promised forth. CASSIUS: Will you dine with me tomorrow? CASCA: Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner worth the eating. CASSIUS: Good. I will expect you. CASCA: Do so. Farewell both. BRUTUS: What a blunt fellow is this grown to be! He was quick mettle when he went to school. CASSIUS: So is he now in execution Of any bold or noble enterprise, However he puts on this tardy form. This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit, Which gives men stomach to digest his words With better appetite. BRUTUS: And so it is. For this time I will leave you. Tomorrow, if you please to speak with me, I will come home to you; or, if you will, Come home to me, and I will wait for you. CASSIUS: I will do so. Till then, think of the world. CASSIUS: Well, Brutus, thou art noble. Yet I see Thy honorable mettle may be wrought From that it is disposed. Therefore it is meet That noble minds keep ever with their likes; For who so firm that cannot be seduced? Caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus. If I were Brutus now, and he were Cassius, He should not humor me.

There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats, For I am armed so strong in honesty That they pass by me as the idle wind, Which I respect not. I did send to you For certain sums of gold, which you denied me, For I can raise no money by vile means. By heaven, I had rather coin my heart And drop my blood for drachmas than to wring From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash By any indirection. I did send To you for gold to pay my legions, Which you denied me. Was that done like Cassius? Should I have answered Caius Cassius so?

O, I could weep My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger, And here my naked breast; within, a heart Dearer than Pluto\\u2019s mine, richer than gold. If that thou be\\u2019st a Roman, take it forth. I that denied thee gold will give my heart. Strike as thou didst at Caesar, for I know When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better Than ever thou lovedst Cassius. BRUTUS: Sheathe your dagger. Be angry when you will, it shall have scope. Do what you will, dishonor shall be humor. O Cassius, you are yok\\u00e8d with a lamb That carries anger as the flint bears fire, Who, much enforc\\u00e8d, shows a hasty spark And straight is cold again. CASSIUS: Hath Cassius lived To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus When grief and blood ill-tempered vexeth him? BRUTUS: When I spoke that, I was ill-tempered too. CASSIUS: Do you confess so much? Give me your hand. BRUTUS: And my heart too. CASSIUS: O Brutus! BRUTUS: What\\u2019s the matter? CASSIUS: Have not you love enough to bear with me When that rash humor which my mother gave me Makes me forgetful? BRUTUS: Yes, Cassius, and from henceforth When you are over-earnest with your Brutus, He\\u2019ll think your mother chides, and leave you so. POET: Let me go in to see the Generals. There is some grudge between \\u2019em; \\u2019tis not meet They be alone. LUCILIUS: You shall not come to them. POET: Nothing but death shall stay me. CASSIUS: How now, what\\u2019s the matter? POET: For shame, you generals, what do you mean? Love and be friends as two such men should be, For I have seen more years, I\\u2019m sure, than ye. CASSIUS: Ha, ha, how vilely doth this cynic rhyme! BRUTUS: Get you hence, sirrah! Saucy fellow, hence! CASSIUS: Bear with him, Brutus. \\u2019Tis his fashion. BRUTUS: I\\u2019ll know his humor when he knows his time. What should the wars do with these jigging fools?\\u2014 Companion, hence! CASSIUS: Away, away, be gone! BRUTUS: Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders Prepare to lodge their companies tonight. CASSIUS: And come yourselves, and bring Messala with you Immediately to us. BRUTUS: Lucius, a bowl of wine. CASSIUS: I did not think you could have been so angry. BRUTUS: O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs. CASSIUS: Of your philosophy you make no use If you give place to accidental evils. BRUTUS: No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead. CASSIUS: Ha? Portia? BRUTUS: She is dead. CASSIUS: How \\u2019scaped I killing when I crossed you so? O insupportable and touching loss! Upon what sickness? BRUTUS: Impatient of my absence, And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony Have made themselves so strong\\u2014for with her death That tidings came\\u2014with this she fell distract And, her attendants absent, swallowed fire. CASSIUS: And died so? BRUTUS: Even so. CASSIUS: O you immortal gods! BRUTUS: Speak no more of her.\\u2014Give me a bowl of wine.\\u2014 In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius. CASSIUS: My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.\\u2014 Fill, Lucius, till the wine o\\u2019erswell the cup; I cannot drink too much of Brutus\\u2019 love. BRUTUS: Come in, Titinius. Welcome, good Messala. Now sit we close about this taper here, And call in question our necessities. CASSIUS: Portia, art thou gone? BRUTUS: No more, I pray you.\\u2014 Messala, I have here receiv\\u00e8d letters That young Octavius and Mark Antony Come down upon us with a mighty power, Bending their expedition toward Philippi. MESSALA: Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor. BRUTUS: With what addition? MESSALA: That by proscription and bills of outlawry, Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus Have put to death an hundred senators. BRUTUS: Therein our letters do not well agree. Mine speak of seventy senators that died By their proscriptions, Cicero being one. CASSIUS: Cicero one? MESSALA: Cicero is dead, And by that order of proscription. Had you your letters from your wife, my lord? BRUTUS: No, Messala. MESSALA: Nor nothing in your letters writ of her? BRUTUS: Nothing, Messala. MESSALA: That methinks is strange. BRUTUS: Why ask you? Hear you aught of her in yours? MESSALA: No, my lord. BRUTUS: Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true. MESSALA: Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell, For certain she is dead, and by strange manner. BRUTUS: Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala. With meditating that she must die once, I have the patience to endure it now. MESSALA: Even so great men great losses should endure. CASSIUS: I have as much of this in art as you, But yet my nature could not bear it so. BRUTUS: Well, to our work alive. What do you think Of marching to Philippi presently? CASSIUS: I do not think it good. BRUTUS: Your reason? CASSIUS: This it is: \\u2019Tis better that the enemy seek us; So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers, Doing himself offense, whilst we, lying still, Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness. BRUTUS: Good reasons must of force give place to better. The people \\u2019twixt Philippi and this ground Do stand but in a forced affection, For they have grudged us contribution. The enemy, marching along by them, By them shall make a fuller number up, Come on refreshed, new-added, and encouraged, From which advantage shall we cut him off If at Philippi we do face him there, These people at our back. CASSIUS: Hear me, good brother\\u2014 BRUTUS: Under your pardon. You must note besides That we have tried the utmost of our friends, Our legions are brim full, our cause is ripe. The enemy increaseth every day; We, at the height, are ready to decline. There is a tide in the affairs of men Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune; Omitted, all the voyage of their life Is bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now afloat, And we must take the current when it serves Or lose our ventures. CASSIUS: Then, with your will, go on; We\\u2019ll along ourselves and meet them at Philippi. BRUTUS: The deep of night is crept upon our talk, And nature must obey necessity, Which we will niggard with a little rest. There is no more to say. CASSIUS: No more. Good night. BRUTUS: Early tomorrow will we rise and hence. BRUTUS: Lucius. BRUTUS: My gown. BRUTUS: Farewell, good Messala.\\u2014 Good night, Titinius.\\u2014Noble, noble Cassius, Good night and good repose. CASSIUS: O my dear brother, This was an ill beginning of the night. Never come such division \\u2019tween our souls! Let it not, Brutus. BRUTUS: Everything is well. CASSIUS: Good night, my lord. BRUTUS: Good night, good brother. TITINIUS/MESSALA: Good night, Lord Brutus. BRUTUS: Farewell, everyone. BRUTUS: Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument? LUCIUS: Here in the tent. BRUTUS: What, thou speak\\u2019st drowsily? Poor knave, I blame thee not; thou art o\\u2019erwatched. Call Claudius and some other of my men; I\\u2019ll have them sleep on cushions in my tent. LUCIUS: Varro and Claudius. VARRO: Calls my lord?"}

CAESAR: Go bid the priests do present sacrifice, And bring me their opinions of success. SERVANT: I will, my lord. CALPHURNIA: What mean you, Caesar? Think you to walk forth? You shall not stir out of your house today. CAESAR: Caesar shall forth. The things that threatened me Ne\\u2019er looked but on my back. When they shall see The face of Caesar, they are vanish\\u00e8d. CALPHURNIA: Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies, Yet now they fright me. There is one within, Besides the things that we have heard and seen, Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch. A lioness hath whelp\\u00e8d in the streets, And graves have yawned and yielded up their dead. Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds In ranks and squadrons and right form of war, Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol. The noise of battle hurtled in the air, Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan, And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets. O Caesar, these things are beyond all use, And I do fear them. CAESAR: What can be avoided Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods? Yet Caesar shall go forth, for these predictions Are to the world in general as to Caesar. CALPHURNIA: When beggars die there are no comets seen; The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes. CAESAR: Cowards die many times before their deaths; The valiant never taste of death but once. Of all the wonders that I yet have heard, It seems to me most strange that men should fear, Seeing that death, a necessary end, Will come when it will come. SERVANT: What say the augurers? SERVANT: They would not have you to stir forth today. Plucking the entrails of an offering forth, They could not find a heart within the beast. CAESAR: The gods do this in shame of cowardice. Caesar should be a beast without a heart If he should stay at home today for fear. No, Caesar shall not. Danger knows full well That Caesar is more dangerous than he. We are two lions littered in one day, And I the elder and more terrible. And Caesar shall go forth. CALPHURNIA: Alas, my lord, Your wisdom is consumed in confidence. Do not go forth today. Call it my fear That keeps you in the house, and not your own. We\\u2019ll send Mark Antony to the Senate House, And he shall say you are not well today. Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this. CAESAR: Mark Antony shall say I am not well, And for thy humor I will stay at home. DECIUS: Here\\u2019s Decius Brutus; he shall tell them so. Caesar, all hail! Good morrow, worthy Caesar. I come to fetch you to the Senate House. CAESAR: And you are come in very happy time To bear my greeting to the Senators And tell them that I will not come today. Cannot is false, and that I dare not, falser. I will not come today. Tell them so, Decius. CALPHURNIA: Say he is sick. CAESAR: Shall Caesar send a lie? Have I in conquest stretched mine arm so far, To be afeard to tell graybeards the truth? Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come. DECIUS: Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause, Lest I be laughed at when I tell them so. CAESAR: The cause is in my will. I will not come. That is enough to satisfy the Senate. But for your private satisfaction, Because I love you, I will let you know. Calphurnia here, my wife, stays me at home. She dreamt tonight she saw my statue, Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts, Did run pure blood; and many lusty Romans Came smiling and did bathe their hands in it. And these does she apply for warnings and portents And evils imminent, and on her knee Hath begged that I will stay at home today. DECIUS: This dream is all amiss interpreted. It was a vision fair and fortunate. Your statue spouting blood in many pipes, In which so many smiling Romans bathed, Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck Reviving blood, and that great men shall press For tinctures, stains, relics, and cognizance. This by Calphurnia\\u2019s dream is signified. CAESAR: And this way have you well expounded it. DECIUS: I have, when you have heard what I can say. And know it now: the Senate have concluded To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar. If you shall send them word you will not come, Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock Apt to be rendered, for someone to say \\u201cBreak up the Senate till another time, When Caesar\\u2019s wife shall meet with better dreams.\\u201d If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper \\u201cLo, Caesar is afraid\\u201d? Pardon me, Caesar, for my dear dear love To your proceeding bids me tell you this, And reason to my love is liable. CAESAR: How foolish do your fears seem now, Calphurnia! I am asham\\u00e8d I did yield to them. Give me my robe, for I will go. CAESAR: And look where Publius is come to fetch me. PUBLIUS: Good morrow, Caesar. CAESAR: Welcome, Publius.\\u2014 What, Brutus, are you stirred so early too?\\u2014 Good morrow, Casca.\\u2014Caius Ligarius, Caesar was ne\\u2019er so much your enemy As that same ague which hath made you lean.\\u2014 What is \\u2019t o\\u2019clock?

Awake, I say! What, Lucius! LUCIUS: Called you, my lord? BRUTUS: Get me a taper in my study, Lucius. When it is lighted, come and call me here. LUCIUS: I will, my lord. BRUTUS: It must be by his death. And for my part I know no personal cause to spurn at him, But for the general. He would be crowned: How that might change his nature, there\\u2019s the question. It is the bright day that brings forth the adder, And that craves wary walking. Crown him that, And then I grant we put a sting in him That at his will he may do danger with. Th\\u2019 abuse of greatness is when it disjoins Remorse from power. And, to speak truth of Caesar, I have not known when his affections swayed More than his reason. But \\u2019tis a common proof That lowliness is young ambition\\u2019s ladder, Whereto the climber-upward turns his face; But, when he once attains the upmost round, He then unto the ladder turns his back, Looks in the clouds, scorching the base degrees By which he did ascend. So Caesar may. Then, lest he may, prevent. And since the quarrel Will bear no color for the thing he is, Fashion it thus: that what he is, augmented, Would run to these and these extremities. And therefore think him as a serpent\\u2019s egg, Which, hatched, would, as his kind, grow mischievous, And kill him in the shell. LUCIUS: The taper burneth in your closet, sir. Searching the window for a flint, I found This paper, thus sealed up, and I am sure It did not lie there when I went to bed. BRUTUS: Get you to bed again. It is not day. Is not tomorrow, boy, the ides of March? LUCIUS: I know not, sir. BRUTUS: Look in the calendar, and bring me word. LUCIUS: I will, sir. BRUTUS: The exhalations, whizzing in the air, Give so much light that I may read by them. Brutus, thou sleep\\u2019st. Awake, and see thyself! Shall Rome, etc. Speak, strike, redress! \\u201cBrutus, thou sleep\\u2019st. Awake.\\u201d Such instigations have been often dropped Where I have took them up. \\u201cShall Rome, etc.\\u201d Thus must I piece it out: Shall Rome stand under one man\\u2019s awe? What, Rome? My ancestors did from the streets of Rome The Tarquin drive when he was called a king. \\u201cSpeak, strike, redress!\\u201d Am I entreated To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise, If the redress will follow, thou receivest Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus. LUCIUS: Sir, March is wasted fifteen days. BRUTUS: \\u2019Tis good. Go to the gate; somebody knocks. Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar, I have not slept. Between the acting of a dreadful thing And the first motion, all the interim is Like a phantasma or a hideous dream. The genius and the mortal instruments Are then in council, and the state of man, Like to a little kingdom, suffers then The nature of an insurrection. LUCIUS: Sir, \\u2019tis your brother Cassius at the door, Who doth desire to see you. BRUTUS: Is he alone? LUCIUS: No, sir. There are more with him. BRUTUS: Do you know them? LUCIUS: No, sir. Their hats are plucked about their ears, And half their faces buried in their cloaks, That by no means I may discover them By any mark of favor. BRUTUS: Let \\u2019em enter. They are the faction. O conspiracy, Sham\\u2019st thou to show thy dang\\u2019rous brow by night, When evils are most free? O, then, by day Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, conspiracy. Hide it in smiles and affability; For if thou path, thy native semblance on, Not Erebus itself were dim enough To hide thee from prevention. CASSIUS: I think we are too bold upon your rest. Good morrow, Brutus. Do we trouble you? BRUTUS: I have been up this hour, awake all night. Know I these men that come along with you? CASSIUS: Yes, every man of them; and no man here But honors you, and every one doth wish You had but that opinion of yourself Which every noble Roman bears of you. This is Trebonius. BRUTUS: He is welcome hither. CASSIUS: This, Decius Brutus. BRUTUS: He is welcome too. CASSIUS: This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber. BRUTUS They are all welcome. What watchful cares do interpose themselves Betwixt your eyes and night? CASSIUS: Shall I entreat a word? DECIUS: Here lies the east; doth not the day break here? CASCA: No. CINNA: O pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray lines That fret the clouds are messengers of day. CASCA: You shall confess that you are both deceived. Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises, Which is a great way growing on the south, Weighing the youthful season of the year. Some two months hence, up higher toward the north He first presents his fire, and the high east Stands, as the Capitol, directly here. BRUTUS: Give me your hands all over, one by one. CASSIUS: And let us swear our resolution. BRUTUS: No, not an oath. If not the face of men, The sufferance of our souls, the time\\u2019s abuse\\u2014 If these be motives weak, break off betimes, And every man hence to his idle bed. So let high-sighted tyranny range on Till each man drop by lottery. But if these\\u2014 As I am sure they do\\u2014bear fire enough To kindle cowards and to steel with valor The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen, What need we any spur but our own cause To prick us to redress? What other bond Than secret Romans that have spoke the word And will not palter? And what other oath Than honesty to honesty engaged That this shall be or we will fall for it? Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous, Old feeble carrions, and such suffering souls That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain The even virtue of our enterprise, Nor th\\u2019 insuppressive mettle of our spirits, To think that or our cause or our performance Did need an oath, when every drop of blood That every Roman bears, and nobly bears, Is guilty of a several bastardy If he do break the smallest particle Of any promise that hath passed from him. CASSIUS: But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him? I think he will stand very strong with us. CASCA: Let us not leave him out. CINNA: No, by no means. METELLUS: O, let us have him, for his silver hairs Will purchase us a good opinion And buy men\\u2019s voices to commend our deeds. It shall be said his judgment ruled our hands. Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear, But all be buried in his gravity. BRUTUS: O, name him not! Let us not break with him, For he will never follow anything That other men begin. CASSIUS: Then leave him out. CASCA: Indeed, he is not fit. DECIUS: Shall no man else be touched, but only Caesar? CASSIUS: Decius, well urged. I think it is not meet Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar, Should outlive Caesar. We shall find of him A shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means, If he improve them, may well stretch so far As to annoy us all; which to prevent, Let Antony and Caesar fall together. BRUTUS: Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius, To cut the head off and then hack the limbs, Like wrath in death and envy afterwards; For Antony is but a limb of Caesar. Let\\u2019s be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius. We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar, And in the spirit of men there is no blood. O, that we then could come by Caesar\\u2019s spirit And not dismember Caesar! But, alas, Caesar must bleed for it. And, gentle friends, Let\\u2019s kill him boldly, but not wrathfully. Let\\u2019s carve him as a dish fit for the gods, Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds. And let our hearts, as subtle masters do, Stir up their servants to an act of rage And after seem to chide \\u2019em. This shall make Our purpose necessary and not envious; Which so appearing to the common eyes, We shall be called purgers, not murderers. And for Mark Antony, think not of him, For he can do no more than Caesar\\u2019s arm When Caesar\\u2019s head is off. CASSIUS: Yet I fear him, For in the engrafted love he bears to Caesar\\u2014 BRUTUS: Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him. If he love Caesar, all that he can do Is to himself: take thought and die for Caesar. And that were much he should, for he is given To sports, to wildness, and much company. TREBONIUS: There is no fear in him. Let him not die, For he will live and laugh at this hereafter. BRUTUS: Peace, count the clock. CASSIUS: The clock hath stricken three. TREBONIUS: \\u2019Tis time to part. CASSIUS: But it is doubtful yet Whether Caesar will come forth today or no, For he is superstitious grown of late, Quite from the main opinion he held once Of fantasy, of dreams, and ceremonies. It may be these apparent prodigies, The unaccustomed terror of this night, And the persuasion of his augurers May hold him from the Capitol today. DECIUS: Never fear that. If he be so resolved, I can o\\u2019ersway him, for he loves to hear That unicorns may be betrayed with trees, And bears with glasses, elephants with holes, Lions with toils, and men with flatterers. But when I tell him he hates flatterers, He says he does, being then most flatter\\u00e8d. Let me work, For I can give his humor the true bent, And I will bring him to the Capitol. CASSIUS: Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him. BRUTUS: By the eighth hour, is that the uttermost? CINNA: Be that the uttermost, and fail not then. METELLUS: Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard, Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey. I wonder none of you have thought of him. BRUTUS: Now, good Metellus, go along by him. He loves me well, and I have given him reasons. Send him but hither, and I\\u2019ll fashion him. CASSIUS: The morning comes upon \\u2019s. We\\u2019ll leave you, Brutus. And, friends, disperse yourselves, but all remember What you have said, and show yourselves true Romans. BRUTUS: Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily. Let not our looks put on our purposes, But bear it, as our Roman actors do, With untired spirits and formal constancy. And so good morrow to you every one. BRUTUS: Boy! Lucius!\\u2014Fast asleep? It is no matter. Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber. Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies Which busy care draws in the brains of men. Therefore thou sleep\\u2019st so sound.

    "question": "Why does Caesar ignore Calpurnia's warnings?",
    "ideal answer": "Decius convinces him that Calpurnia has interpreted the dream and the omens incorrectly",
    "model_answer": {"answer": "Caesar ignores Calpurnia's warnings because he is confident in his own destiny and believes that he is invincible. He also seems to be dismissive of her concerns, saying 'Always I am Caesar' (Act 2 Scene 3). This suggests that he has a strong sense of self-importance and does not believe that anyone or anything can harm him.\\n\\nAdditionally, Calpurnia's warnings are likely motivated by her love for Caesar and her desire to protect him. However, Caesar's response implies that he does not value her concerns or see them as legitimate.\\n\\nIt's also worth noting that Caesar's behavior is consistent with the theme of hubris in the play. He has become so powerful and confident that he believes himself to be above the law and immune to harm. This arrogance ultimately leads to his downfall, as he fails to heed the warnings of those around him and ignores the signs of impending danger.\\n\\nOverall, Caesar's ignoring of Calpurnia's warnings is a key moment in the play, highlighting his flaws and setting the stage for the tragic events that will unfold.", "context": "SOURCE: act-2_scene-2.txt\\nsearch_document:[Keywords: ' t o\\u2019clock, ? servant, a - night, a beast, a crown, a fountain, a heart, a lie, a lioness hath whelp\\u00e8d, a necessary end, a vision, ague, air, all hail, all the wonder, all use, an hour \\u2019s talk, an hundred spout, an offering, another time, antony, arm, asham\\u00e8d, augurer, back, battle, beast, beggar, bid, blood, brutus, caesar, caesar \\u2019s wife, caesar!\\u201d\\u2014who, calphurnia, calphurnia \\u2019s dream, capitol, casca.\\u2014caius ligarius, cause, ceremony, cloud, cognizance, comet, confidence, conquest, conquest stretch mine arm, courtesy, coward, cowardice, crown, danger, day, death, decius, decius brutus, dream, earth, end, enemy, entrail, every, evil, face, fear, fierce fiery warrior, form, fountain, friend, ghost, god, good friend, good morrow, grave, graybeard, great, great man, great rome, greeting, hail, hand, hath, heart, heaven, her knee hath, her sleep, himself, home, horse, hour, house, humor, knee, lie, ligarius, lion, lioness, lord, love, man, many lusty roman, many pipe, mark, mark antony, mighty caesar, mind, morrow, most horrid sight, most mighty caesar, most noble caesar, my back, my dear dear love, my fear, my greeting, my knee, my lord, my love, my robe, my statue, my wife, my will, ne\\u2019er, night, no comet, noise, o caesar, offering, one day, opinion, o\\u2019clock, pain, peace, pipe, portent, prediction, present sacrifice, priest, prince, proceeding, publius, pure blood, rank, reason, relic, right form, robe, roman, rome, sacrifice, satisfaction, scene:2, senate, senator, servant, shame, sight, sleep, so many smile roman, some cause, some wine, someone, spout, squadron, stain, statue, store, street, success, talk, taste, that, that death, that same ague, the air, the augurer, the beast, the capitol, the cause, the cloud, the death, the entrail, the face, the god, the heart, the heaven, the house, the mighty god, the noise, the priest, the senate, the senate house, the senator, the street, the thing, the truth, the valiant, the watch, the world, their death, their hand, their mind, their opinion, themselves, these, these prediction, these thing, they, thing, this, this day, this dream, thrice, thrice hath calphurnia, thy humor, time, tincture, tis, today, tonight, trebonius, truth, two lion, up.\\u2014good, up.\\u2014good morrow, use, valiant, vanish\\u00e8d, very happy time, vision, war, warning, warrior, watch, way, welcome, well dream, what, whelp\\u00e8d, which, whose end, wife, will, wine, wisdom, wonder, word, world, worthy caesar, your enemy, your fear, your good friend, your house, your pain, your private satisfaction, your proceeding bid, your statue spout blood, your wisdom]\\n\\nAct:2 Scene:2 CAESAR: Nor heaven nor Earth have been at peace tonight.

CAESAR: Go bid the priests do present sacrifice, And bring me their opinions of success. SERVANT: I will, my lord. CALPHURNIA: What mean you, Caesar? Think you to walk forth? You shall not stir out of your house today. CAESAR: Caesar shall forth. The things that threatened me Ne\\u2019er looked but on my back. When they shall see The face of Caesar, they are vanish\\u00e8d. CALPHURNIA: Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies, Yet now they fright me. There is one within, Besides the things that we have heard and seen, Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch. A lioness hath whelp\\u00e8d in the streets, And graves have yawned and yielded up their dead. Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds In ranks and squadrons and right form of war, Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol. The noise of battle hurtled in the air, Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan, And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets. O Caesar, these things are beyond all use, And I do fear them. CAESAR: What can be avoided Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods? Yet Caesar shall go forth, for these predictions Are to the world in general as to Caesar. CALPHURNIA: When beggars die there are no comets seen; The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes. CAESAR: Cowards die many times before their deaths; The valiant never taste of death but once. Of all the wonders that I yet have heard, It seems to me most strange that men should fear, Seeing that death, a necessary end, Will come when it will come. SERVANT: What say the augurers? SERVANT: They would not have you to stir forth today. Plucking the entrails of an offering forth, They could not find a heart within the beast. CAESAR: The gods do this in shame of cowardice. Caesar should be a beast without a heart If he should stay at home today for fear. No, Caesar shall not. Danger knows full well That Caesar is more dangerous than he. We are two lions littered in one day, And I the elder and more terrible. And Caesar shall go forth. CALPHURNIA: Alas, my lord, Your wisdom is consumed in confidence. Do not go forth today. Call it my fear That keeps you in the house, and not your own. We\\u2019ll send Mark Antony to the Senate House, And he shall say you are not well today. Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this. CAESAR: Mark Antony shall say I am not well, And for thy humor I will stay at home. DECIUS: Here\\u2019s Decius Brutus; he shall tell them so. Caesar, all hail! Good morrow, worthy Caesar. I come to fetch you to the Senate House. CAESAR: And you are come in very happy time To bear my greeting to the Senators And tell them that I will not come today. Cannot is false, and that I dare not, falser. I will not come today. Tell them so, Decius. CALPHURNIA: Say he is sick. CAESAR: Shall Caesar send a lie? Have I in conquest stretched mine arm so far, To be afeard to tell graybeards the truth? Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come. DECIUS: Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause, Lest I be laughed at when I tell them so. CAESAR: The cause is in my will. I will not come. That is enough to satisfy the Senate. But for your private satisfaction, Because I love you, I will let you know. Calphurnia here, my wife, stays me at home. She dreamt tonight she saw my statue, Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts, Did run pure blood; and many lusty Romans Came smiling and did bathe their hands in it. And these does she apply for warnings and portents And evils imminent, and on her knee Hath begged that I will stay at home today. DECIUS: This dream is all amiss interpreted. It was a vision fair and fortunate. Your statue spouting blood in many pipes, In which so many smiling Romans bathed, Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck Reviving blood, and that great men shall press For tinctures, stains, relics, and cognizance. This by Calphurnia\\u2019s dream is signified. CAESAR: And this way have you well expounded it. DECIUS: I have, when you have heard what I can say. And know it now: the Senate have concluded To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar. If you shall send them word you will not come, Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock Apt to be rendered, for someone to say \\u201cBreak up the Senate till another time, When Caesar\\u2019s wife shall meet with better dreams.\\u201d If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper \\u201cLo, Caesar is afraid\\u201d? Pardon me, Caesar, for my dear dear love To your proceeding bids me tell you this, And reason to my love is liable. CAESAR: How foolish do your fears seem now, Calphurnia! I am asham\\u00e8d I did yield to them. Give me my robe, for I will go. CAESAR: And look where Publius is come to fetch me. PUBLIUS: Good morrow, Caesar. CAESAR: Welcome, Publius.\\u2014 What, Brutus, are you stirred so early too?\\u2014 Good morrow, Casca.\\u2014Caius Ligarius, Caesar was ne\\u2019er so much your enemy As that same ague which hath made you lean.\\u2014 What is \\u2019t o\\u2019clock?

CAESAR: Good friends, go in and taste some wine with me, And we, like friends, will straightway go together.

Caesar speaks. CAESAR: Calphurnia. CALPHURNIA: Here, my lord. CAESAR: Stand you directly in Antonius\\u2019 way When he doth run his course.\\u2014Antonius. ANTONY: Caesar, my lord.

Peace, yet again! CAESAR: Who is it in the press that calls on me? I hear a tongue shriller than all the music Cry \\u201cCaesar.\\u201d Speak. Caesar is turned to hear. SOOTHSAYER: Beware the ides of March. CAESAR: What man is that? BRUTUS: A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March. CAESAR: Set him before me. Let me see his face. CASSIUS: Fellow, come from the throng. CASSIUS: Look upon Caesar. CAESAR: What sayst thou to me now? Speak once again. SOOTHSAYER: Beware the ides of March. CAESAR: He is a dreamer. Let us leave him. Pass. CASSIUS: Will you go see the order of the course? BRUTUS: Not I. CASSIUS: I pray you, do. BRUTUS: I am not gamesome. I do lack some part Of that quick spirit that is in Antony. Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires. I\\u2019ll leave you. CASSIUS: Brutus, I do observe you now of late. I have not from your eyes that gentleness And show of love as I was wont to have. You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand Over your friend that loves you. BRUTUS: Cassius, Be not deceived. If I have veiled my look, I turn the trouble of my countenance Merely upon myself. Vex\\u00e8d I am Of late with passions of some difference, Conceptions only proper to myself, Which give some soil, perhaps, to my behaviors. But let not therefore my good friends be grieved (Among which number, Cassius, be you one) Nor construe any further my neglect Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war, Forgets the shows of love to other men. CASSIUS: Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion, By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations. Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face? BRUTUS: No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself But by reflection, by some other things. CASSIUS: \\u2019Tis just. And it is very much lamented, Brutus, That you have no such mirrors as will turn Your hidden worthiness into your eye, That you might see your shadow. I have heard Where many of the best respect in Rome, Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus And groaning underneath this age\\u2019s yoke, Have wished that noble Brutus had his eyes. BRUTUS: Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius, That you would have me seek into myself For that which is not in me? CASSIUS: Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear. And since you know you cannot see yourself So well as by reflection, I, your glass, Will modestly discover to yourself That of yourself which you yet know not of. And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus. Were I a common laughter, or did use To stale with ordinary oaths my love To every new protester; if you know That I do fawn on men and hug them hard And after scandal them, or if you know That I profess myself in banqueting To all the rout, then hold me dangerous. BRUTUS: What means this shouting? I do fear the people Choose Caesar for their king. CASSIUS: Ay, do you fear it? Then must I think you would not have it so. BRUTUS: I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well. But wherefore do you hold me here so long? What is it that you would impart to me? If it be aught toward the general good, Set honor in one eye and death i\\u2019 th\\u2019 other And I will look on both indifferently; For let the gods so speed me as I love The name of honor more than I fear death. CASSIUS: I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus, As well as I do know your outward favor. Well, honor is the subject of my story. I cannot tell what you and other men Think of this life; but, for my single self, I had as lief not be as live to be In awe of such a thing as I myself. I was born free as Caesar; so were you; We both have fed as well, and we can both Endure the winter\\u2019s cold as well as he. For once, upon a raw and gusty day, The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores, Caesar said to me \\u201cDar\\u2019st thou, Cassius, now Leap in with me into this angry flood And swim to yonder point?\\u201d Upon the word, Accoutered as I was, I plung\\u00e8d in And bade him follow; so indeed he did. The torrent roared, and we did buffet it With lusty sinews, throwing it aside And stemming it with hearts of controversy. But ere we could arrive the point proposed, Caesar cried \\u201cHelp me, Cassius, or I sink!\\u201d I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor, Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber Did I the tired Caesar. And this man Is now become a god, and Cassius is A wretched creature and must bend his body If Caesar carelessly but nod on him. He had a fever when he was in Spain, And when the fit was on him, I did mark How he did shake. \\u2019Tis true, this god did shake. His coward lips did from their color fly, And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world Did lose his luster. I did hear him groan. Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans Mark him and write his speeches in their books, \\u201cAlas,\\u201d it cried \\u201cGive me some drink, Titinius\\u201d As a sick girl. You gods, it doth amaze me A man of such a feeble temper should So get the start of the majestic world And bear the palm alone. BRUTUS: Another general shout! I do believe that these applauses are For some new honors that are heaped on Caesar. CASSIUS: Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world Like a Colossus, and we petty men Walk under his huge legs and peep about To find ourselves dishonorable graves. Men at some time are masters of their fates. The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, But in ourselves, that we are underlings. \\u201cBrutus\\u201d and \\u201cCaesar\\u201d\\u2014what should be in that \\u201cCaesar\\u201d? Why should that name be sounded more than yours? Write them together, yours is as fair a name; Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well; Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with \\u2019em, \\u201cBrutus\\u201d will start a spirit as soon as \\u201cCaesar.\\u201d Now, in the names of all the gods at once, Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed! Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods! When went there by an age, since the great flood, But it was famed with more than with one man? When could they say, till now, that talked of Rome, That her wide walks encompassed but one man? Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough When there is in it but one only man. O, you and I have heard our fathers say There was a Brutus once that would have brooked Th\\u2019 eternal devil to keep his state in Rome As easily as a king. BRUTUS: That you do love me, I am nothing jealous. What you would work me to, I have some aim. How I have thought of this, and of these times, I shall recount hereafter. For this present, I would not, so with love I might entreat you, Be any further moved. What you have said I will consider; what you have to say I will with patience hear, and find a time Both meet to hear and answer such high things. Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this: Brutus had rather be a villager Than to repute himself a son of Rome Under these hard conditions as this time Is like to lay upon us. CASSIUS: I am glad that my weak words Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus. BRUTUS: The games are done, and Caesar is returning. CASSIUS: As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve, And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you What hath proceeded worthy note today. BRUTUS: I will do so. But look you, Cassius, The angry spot doth glow on Caesar\\u2019s brow, And all the rest look like a chidden train. Calphurnia\\u2019s cheek is pale, and Cicero Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes As we have seen him in the Capitol, Being crossed in conference by some senators. CASSIUS: Casca will tell us what the matter is. CAESAR: Antonius. ANTONY: Caesar. CAESAR: Let me have men about me that are fat, Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep a-nights. Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look. He thinks too much. Such men are dangerous. ANTONY: Fear him not, Caesar; he\\u2019s not dangerous. He is a noble Roman, and well given. CAESAR: Would he were fatter! But I fear him not. Yet if my name were liable to fear, I do not know the man I should avoid So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much, He is a great observer, and he looks Quite through the deeds of men. He loves no plays, As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music; Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort As if he mocked himself and scorned his spirit That could be moved to smile at anything. Such men as he be never at heart\\u2019s ease Whiles they behold a greater than themselves, And therefore are they very dangerous. I rather tell thee what is to be feared Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar. Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf, And tell me truly what thou think\\u2019st of him. CASCA: You pulled me by the cloak. Would you speak with me? BRUTUS: Ay, Casca. Tell us what hath chanced today That Caesar looks so sad. CASCA: Why, you were with him, were you not? BRUTUS: I should not then ask Casca what had chanced. CASCA: Why, there was a crown offered him; and, being offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand, thus, and then the people fell a-shouting. BRUTUS: What was the second noise for? CASCA: Why, for that too. CASSIUS: They shouted thrice. What was the last cry for? CASCA: Why, for that too. BRUTUS: Was the crown offered him thrice? CASCA: Ay, marry, was \\u2019t, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler than other; and at every putting-by, mine honest neighbors shouted. CASSIUS: Who offered him the crown? CASCA: Why, Antony.

If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar\\u2019s, to him I say that Brutus\\u2019 love to Caesar was no less than his. If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer: not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living, and die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live all freemen? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him. As he was fortunate, I rejoice at it. As he was valiant, I honor him. But, as he was ambitious, I slew him. There is tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor for his valor, and death for his ambition. Who is here so base that would be a bondman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so vile that will not love his country? If any, speak, for him have I offended. I pause for a reply. PLEBEIANS: None, Brutus, none. BRUTUS: Then none have I offended.

Let us hear him. ANTONY: Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears. I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. The evil that men do lives after them; The good is oft interr\\u00e8d with their bones. So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus Hath told you Caesar was ambitious. If it were so, it was a grievous fault, And grievously hath Caesar answered it. Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest (For Brutus is an honorable man; So are they all, all honorable men), Come I to speak in Caesar\\u2019s funeral. He was my friend, faithful and just to me, But Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man. He hath brought many captives home to Rome, Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill. Did this in Caesar seem ambitious? When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept; Ambition should be made of sterner stuff. Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man. You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown, Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And sure he is an honorable man. I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, But here I am to speak what I do know. You all did love him once, not without cause. What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for him?\\u2014 O judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, And men have lost their reason!\\u2014Bear with me; My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar, And I must pause till it come back to me. FIRST PLEBEIAN: Methinks there is much reason in his sayings. SECOND PLEBEIAN: If thou consider rightly of the matter, Caesar has had great wrong. THIRD PLEBEIAN: Has he, masters? I fear there will a worse come in his place. FOURTH PLEBEIAN: Marked you his words? He would not take the crown; Therefore \\u2019tis certain he was not ambitious. FIRST PLEBEIAN: If it be found so, some will dear abide it. SECOND PLEBEIAN: Poor soul, his eyes are red as fire with weeping. THIRD PLEBEIAN: There\\u2019s not a nobler man in Rome than Antony. FOURTH PLEBEIAN: Now mark him. He begins again to speak. ANTONY: But yesterday the word of Caesar might Have stood against the world. Now lies he there, And none so poor to do him reverence. O masters, if I were disposed to stir Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage, I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong, Who, you all know, are honorable men. I will not do them wrong. I rather choose To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you, Than I will wrong such honorable men. But here\\u2019s a parchment with the seal of Caesar. I found it in his closet. \\u2019Tis his will. Let but the commons hear this testament, Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read, And they would go and kiss dead Caesar\\u2019s wounds And dip their napkins in his sacred blood\\u2014 Yea, beg a hair of him for memory And, dying, mention it within their wills, Bequeathing it as a rich legacy Unto their issue. FOURTH PLEBEIAN: We\\u2019ll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony. PLEBEIANS: The will, the will! We will hear Caesar\\u2019s will. ANTONY: Have patience, gentle friends. I must not read it. It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you. You are not wood, you are not stones, but men. And, being men, hearing the will of Caesar, It will inflame you; it will make you mad. \\u2019Tis good you know not that you are his heirs, For if you should, O, what would come of it? FOURTH PLEBEIAN: Read the will! We\\u2019ll hear it, Antony. PLEBEIANS: You shall read us the will, Caesar\\u2019s will. ANTONY: Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile? I have o\\u2019ershot myself to tell you of it. I fear I wrong the honorable men Whose daggers have stabbed Caesar. I do fear it. FOURTH PLEBEIAN: They were traitors. Honorable men? PLEBEIANS: The will! The testament! SECOND PLEBEIAN: They were villains, murderers. The will! Read the will. ANTONY: You will compel me, then, to read the will? Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar, And let me show you him that made the will. Shall I descend? And will you give me leave? PLEBEIANS: Come down. SECOND PLEBEIAN: Descend. THIRD PLEBEIAN: You shall have leave. FOURTH PLEBEIAN: A ring; stand round. FIRST PLEBEIAN: Stand from the hearse. Stand from the body. SECOND PLEBEIAN: Room for Antony, most noble Antony. ANTONY: Nay, press not so upon me. Stand far off. PLEBEIANS: Stand back! Room! Bear back! ANTONY: If you have tears, prepare to shed them now. You all do know this mantle. I remember The first time ever Caesar put it on. \\u2019Twas on a summer\\u2019s evening in his tent, That day he overcame the Nervii. Look, in this place ran Cassius\\u2019 dagger through. See what a rent the envious Casca made. Through this the well-belov\\u00e8d Brutus stabbed, And, as he plucked his curs\\u00e8d steel away, Mark how the blood of Caesar followed it, As rushing out of doors to be resolved If Brutus so unkindly knocked or no; For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar\\u2019s angel. Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him! This was the most unkindest cut of all. For when the noble Caesar saw him stab, Ingratitude, more strong than traitors\\u2019 arms, Quite vanquished him. Then burst his mighty heart, And, in his mantle muffling up his face, Even at the base of Pompey\\u2019s statue (Which all the while ran blood) great Caesar fell. O, what a fall was there, my countrymen! Then I and you and all of us fell down, Whilst bloody treason flourished over us. O, now you weep, and I perceive you feel The dint of pity. These are gracious drops. Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold Here is himself, marred as you see with traitors. FIRST PLEBEIAN: O piteous spectacle! SECOND PLEBEIAN: O noble Caesar! THIRD PLEBEIAN: O woeful day! FOURTH PLEBEIAN: O traitors, villains! FIRST PLEBEIAN: O most bloody sight! SECOND PLEBEIAN: We will be revenged. PLEBEIANS: Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay! Let not a traitor live! ANTONY: Stay, countrymen. FIRST PLEBEIAN: Peace there! Hear the noble Antony. SECOND PLEBEIAN: We\\u2019ll hear him, we\\u2019ll follow him, we\\u2019ll die with him. ANTONY: Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up To such a sudden flood of mutiny. They that have done this deed are honorable. What private griefs they have, alas, I know not, That made them do it. They are wise and honorable And will no doubt with reasons answer you. I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts. I am no orator, as Brutus is, But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man That love my friend, and that they know full well That gave me public leave to speak of him. For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth, Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech To stir men\\u2019s blood. I only speak right on. I tell you that which you yourselves do know, Show you sweet Caesar\\u2019s wounds, poor poor dumb mouths, And bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus, And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue In every wound of Caesar that should move The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.

PLEBEIANS: Peace, ho! Hear Antony, most noble Antony! ANTONY: Why, friends, you go to do you know not what. Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves? Alas, you know not. I must tell you then.

SOOTHSAYER: Ay, Caesar, but not gone. ARTEMIDORUS: Hail, Caesar. Read this schedule. DECIUS: Trebonius doth desire you to o\\u2019erread, At your best leisure, this his humble suit. ARTEMIDORUS: O Caesar, read mine first, for mine\\u2019s a suit That touches Caesar nearer. Read it, great Caesar. CAESAR: What touches us ourself shall be last served. ARTEMIDORUS: Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly. CAESAR: What, is the fellow mad? PUBLIUS: Sirrah, give place. CASSIUS: What, urge you your petitions in the street? Come to the Capitol. POPILIUS: I wish your enterprise today may thrive. CASSIUS: What enterprise, Popilius? POPILIUS: Fare you well. BRUTUS: What said Popilius Lena? CASSIUS: He wished today our enterprise might thrive. I fear our purpose is discover\\u00e8d. BRUTUS: Look how he makes to Caesar. Mark him. CASSIUS: Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.\\u2014 Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known, Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back, For I will slay myself. BRUTUS: Cassius, be constant. Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes, For look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change. CASSIUS: Trebonius knows his time, for look you, Brutus, He draws Mark Antony out of the way. DECIUS: Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go And presently prefer his suit to Caesar. BRUTUS: He is addressed. Press near and second him. CINNA: Casca, you are the first that rears your hand. CAESAR: Are we all ready? What is now amiss That Caesar and his Senate must redress? METELLUS: Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar, Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat An humble heart. CAESAR: I must prevent thee, Cimber. These couchings and these lowly courtesies Might fire the blood of ordinary men And turn preordinance and first decree Into the law of children. Be not fond To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood That will be thawed from the true quality With that which melteth fools\\u2014I mean sweet words, Low-crook\\u00e8d curtsies, and base spaniel fawning. Thy brother by decree is banish\\u00e8d. If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him, I spurn thee like a cur out of my way. Know: Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause Will he be satisfied. METELLUS: Is there no voice more worthy than my own To sound more sweetly in great Caesar\\u2019s ear For the repealing of my banished brother? BRUTUS: I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar, Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may Have an immediate freedom of repeal. CAESAR: What, Brutus? CASSIUS: Pardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon! As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber. CAESAR: I could be well moved, if I were as you. If I could pray to move, prayers would move me. But I am constant as the Northern Star, Of whose true fixed and resting quality There is no fellow in the firmament. The skies are painted with unnumbered sparks; They are all fire, and every one doth shine. But there\\u2019s but one in all doth hold his place. So in the world: \\u2019tis furnished well with men, And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive. Yet in the number I do know but one That unassailable holds on his rank, Unshaked of motion; and that I am he Let me a little show it, even in this: That I was constant Cimber should be banished And constant do remain to keep him so. CINNA: O Caesar\\u2014 CAESAR: Hence. Wilt thou lift up Olympus? DECIUS: Great Caesar\\u2014 CAESAR: Doth not Brutus bootless kneel? CASCA: Speak, hands, for me! CAESAR: Et tu, Brut\\u00e8?\\u2014Then fall, Caesar. CINNA: Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead! Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets. CASSIUS: Some to the common pulpits and cry out \\u201cLiberty, freedom, and enfranchisement.\\u201d BRUTUS: People and Senators, be not affrighted. Fly not; stand still. Ambition\\u2019s debt is paid. CASCA: Go to the pulpit, Brutus. DECIUS: And Cassius too. BRUTUS: Where\\u2019s Publius? CINNA: Here, quite confounded with this mutiny. METELLUS: Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar\\u2019s Should chance\\u2014 BRUTUS: Talk not of standing.\\u2014Publius, good cheer. There is no harm intended to your person, Nor to no Roman else. So tell them, Publius. CASSIUS: And leave us, Publius, lest that the people, Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief. BRUTUS: Do so, and let no man abide this deed But we the doers. CASSIUS: Where is Antony? TREBONIUS: Fled to his house amazed. Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run As it were doomsday. BRUTUS: Fates, we will know your pleasures. That we shall die we know; \\u2019tis but the time, And drawing days out, that men stand upon. CASCA: Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life Cuts off so many years of fearing death. BRUTUS: Grant that, and then is death a benefit. So are we Caesar\\u2019s friends, that have abridged His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop, And let us bathe our hands in Caesar\\u2019s blood Up to the elbows and besmear our swords. Then walk we forth, even to the marketplace, And, waving our red weapons o\\u2019er our heads, Let\\u2019s all cry \\u201cPeace, freedom, and liberty!\\u201d CASSIUS: Stoop then, and wash. How many ages hence Shall this our lofty scene be acted over In states unborn and accents yet unknown! BRUTUS: How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport, That now on Pompey\\u2019s basis lies along No worthier than the dust! CASSIUS: So oft as that shall be, So often shall the knot of us be called The men that gave their country liberty. DECIUS: What, shall we forth? CASSIUS: Ay, every man away. Brutus shall lead, and we will grace his heels With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome. BRUTUS: Soft, who comes here? A friend of Antony\\u2019s. SERVANT: Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel. Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down, And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say: Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest; Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving. Say, I love Brutus, and I honor him; Say, I feared Caesar, honored him, and loved him. If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony May safely come to him and be resolved How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death, Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead So well as Brutus living, but will follow The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus Thorough the hazards of this untrod state With all true faith. So says my master Antony. BRUTUS: Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman. I never thought him worse. Tell him, so please him come unto this place, He shall be satisfied and, by my honor, Depart untouched. SERVANT: I\\u2019ll fetch him presently. BRUTUS: I know that we shall have him well to friend. CASSIUS: I wish we may; but yet have I a mind That fears him much, and my misgiving still Falls shrewdly to the purpose. BRUTUS: But here comes Antony.\\u2014Welcome, Mark Antony! ANTONY: O mighty Caesar, dost thou lie so low? Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.\\u2014 I know not, gentlemen, what you intend, Who else must be let blood, who else is rank. If I myself, there is no hour so fit As Caesar\\u2019s death\\u2019s hour, nor no instrument Of half that worth as those your swords made rich With the most noble blood of all this world. I do beseech you, if you bear me hard, Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke, Fulfill your pleasure. Live a thousand years, I shall not find myself so apt to die; No place will please me so, no mean of death, As here by Caesar, and by you cut off, The choice and master spirits of this age. BRUTUS: O Antony, beg not your death of us! Though now we must appear bloody and cruel, As by our hands and this our present act You see we do, yet see you but our hands And this the bleeding business they have done. Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful; And pity to the general wrong of Rome (As fire drives out fire, so pity pity) Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part, To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony. Our arms in strength of malice, and our hearts Of brothers\\u2019 temper, do receive you in With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence. CASSIUS: Your voice shall be as strong as any man\\u2019s In the disposing of new dignities. BRUTUS: Only be patient till we have appeased The multitude, beside themselves with fear; And then we will deliver you the cause Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him, Have thus proceeded. ANTONY: I doubt not of your wisdom. Let each man render me his bloody hand. First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you.\\u2014 Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand.\\u2014 Now, Decius Brutus, yours;\\u2014now yours, Metellus;\\u2014 Yours, Cinna;\\u2014and, my valiant Casca, yours;\\u2014 Though last, not least in love, yours, good Trebonius.\\u2014 Gentlemen all\\u2014alas, what shall I say? My credit now stands on such slippery ground That one of two bad ways you must conceit me, Either a coward or a flatterer.\\u2014 That I did love thee, Caesar, O, \\u2019tis true! If then thy spirit look upon us now, Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death To see thy Antony making his peace, Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes\\u2014 Most noble!\\u2014in the presence of thy corpse? Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds, Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood, It would become me better than to close In terms of friendship with thine enemies. Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bayed, brave hart, Here didst thou fall, and here thy hunters stand Signed in thy spoil and crimsoned in thy Lethe. O world, thou wast the forest to this hart, And this indeed, O world, the heart of thee. How like a deer strucken by many princes Dost thou here lie! CASSIUS: Mark Antony\\u2014 ANTONY: Pardon me, Caius Cassius. The enemies of Caesar shall say this; Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty. CASSIUS: I blame you not for praising Caesar so. But what compact mean you to have with us? Will you be pricked in number of our friends, Or shall we on and not depend on you? ANTONY: Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed Swayed from the point by looking down on Caesar. Friends am I with you all and love you all, Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous. BRUTUS: Or else were this a savage spectacle. Our reasons are so full of good regard That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar, You should be satisfied. ANTONY: That\\u2019s all I seek; And am, moreover, suitor that I may Produce his body to the marketplace, And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend, Speak in the order of his funeral. BRUTUS: You shall, Mark Antony. CASSIUS: Brutus, a word with you. CASSIUS: You know not what you do. Do not consent That Antony speak in his funeral. Know you how much the people may be moved By that which he will utter? BRUTUS: By your pardon, I will myself into the pulpit first And show the reason of our Caesar\\u2019s death. What Antony shall speak I will protest He speaks by leave and by permission, And that we are contented Caesar shall Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies. It shall advantage more than do us wrong. CASSIUS: I know not what may fall. I like it not."}

    "question": "Why do Brutus and Cassius argue?",
    "ideal answer": "Brutus asked for money and Cassius withheld it",
    "model_answer": {"answer": "A most pertinent question, good sir! According to Act 4, Scene 3, Brutus and Cassius argue due to their differing opinions on how to proceed with the funeral rites of Julius Caesar. Cassius objects to Brutus' plan, suggesting that Antony's eulogy may stir up the crowd against them (CASSIUS: I know not what may fall. I like it not.). This disagreement highlights the tension and mistrust between the two conspirators, as they struggle with their own emotions and loyalties in the aftermath of Caesar's assassination.", "context": "SOURCE: act-4_scene-3.txt\\nrepose. CASSIUS: O my dear brother, This was an ill beginning of the night. Never come such division \\u2019tween our souls! Let it not, Brutus. BRUTUS: Everything is well. CASSIUS: Good night, my lord. BRUTUS: Good night, good brother. TITINIUS/MESSALA: Good night, Lord Brutus. BRUTUS: Farewell, everyone. BRUTUS: Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument? LUCIUS: Here in the tent. BRUTUS: What, thou speak\\u2019st drowsily? Poor knave, I blame thee not; thou art o\\u2019erwatched. Call Claudius and some other of my men; I\\u2019ll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.

It may be I shall raise you by and by On business to my brother Cassius.\\n\\n---\\n\\nSOURCE: act-4_scene-3.txt\\nAct:4 Scene:3 CASSIUS: That you have wronged me doth appear in this: You have condemned and noted Lucius Pella For taking bribes here of the Sardians, Wherein my letters, praying on his side Because I knew the man, was slighted off. BRUTUS: You wronged yourself to write in such a case. CASSIUS: In such a time as this it is not meet That every nice offense should bear his comment. BRUTUS: Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself Are much condemned to have an itching palm, To sell and mart your offices for gold To undeservers. CASSIUS: I an itching palm? You know that you are Brutus that speaks this, Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last. BRUTUS: The name of Cassius honors this corruption, And chastisement doth therefore hide his head. CASSIUS: Chastisement? BRUTUS: Remember March; the ides of March remember. Did not great Julius bleed for justice\\u2019 sake? What villain touched his body that did stab And not for justice? What, shall one of us That struck the foremost man of all this world But for supporting robbers, shall we now Contaminate our fingers with base bribes And sell the mighty space of our large honors For so much trash as may be grasp\\u00e8d thus? I had rather be a dog and bay the moon Than such a Roman. CASSIUS: Brutus, bait not me. I\\u2019ll not endure it. You forget yourself To hedge me in. I am a soldier, I, Older in practice, abler than yourself To make conditions. BRUTUS: Go to! You are not, Cassius. CASSIUS: I am. BRUTUS: I say you are not. CASSIUS: Urge me no more. I shall forget myself. Have mind upon your health. Tempt me no farther. BRUTUS: Away, slight man! CASSIUS: Is \\u2019t possible? BRUTUS: Hear me, for I will speak. Must I give way and room to your rash choler? Shall I be frighted when a madman stares? CASSIUS: O you gods, you gods, must I endure all this? BRUTUS: All this? Ay, more. Fret till your proud heart break. Go show your slaves how choleric you are And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge? Must I observe you? Must I stand and crouch Under your testy humor? By the gods, You shall digest the venom of your spleen Though it do split you. For, from this day forth, I\\u2019ll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter, When you are waspish. CASSIUS: Is it come to this? BRUTUS: You say you are a better soldier. Let it appear so, make your vaunting true, And it shall please me well. For mine own part, I shall be glad to learn of noble men. CASSIUS: You wrong me every way, you wrong me, Brutus. I said an elder soldier, not a better. Did I say \\u201cbetter\\u201d? BRUTUS: If you did, I care not. CASSIUS: When Caesar lived he durst not thus have moved me. BRUTUS: Peace, peace! You durst not so have tempted him. CASSIUS: I durst not? BRUTUS: No. CASSIUS: What? Durst not tempt him? BRUTUS: For your life you durst not. CASSIUS: Do not presume too much upon my love. I may do that I shall be sorry for. BRUTUS: You have done that you should be sorry for. There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats, For I am armed so strong in honesty That they pass by me as the idle wind, Which I respect not. I did send to you For certain sums of gold, which you denied me, For I can raise no money by vile means. By heaven, I had rather coin my heart And drop my blood for drachmas than to wring From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash By any indirection. I did send To you for gold to pay my legions, Which you denied me. Was that done like Cassius? Should I have answered Caius Cassius so? When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous To lock such rascal counters from his friends, Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts; Dash him to pieces! CASSIUS: I denied you not. BRUTUS: You did. CASSIUS: I did not. He was but a fool that brought My answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart. A friend should bear his friend\\u2019s infirmities, But Brutus makes mine greater than they are. BRUTUS: I do not, till you practice them on me. CASSIUS: You love me not. BRUTUS: I do not like your faults. CASSIUS: A friendly eye could never see such faults. BRUTUS: A flatterer\\u2019s would not, though they do appear As huge as high Olympus. CASSIUS: Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come! Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius, For Cassius is aweary of the world\\u2014 Hated by one he loves, braved by his brother, Checked like a bondman, all his faults observed, Set in a notebook, learned and conned by rote To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger, And here my naked breast; within, a heart Dearer than Pluto\\u2019s mine, richer than gold. If that thou be\\u2019st a Roman, take it forth. I that denied thee gold will give my heart. Strike as thou didst at Caesar, for I know When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better Than ever thou lovedst Cassius. BRUTUS: Sheathe your dagger. Be angry when you will, it shall have scope. Do what you will, dishonor shall be humor. O Cassius, you are yok\\u00e8d with a lamb That carries anger as the flint bears fire, Who, much enforc\\u00e8d, shows a hasty spark And straight is cold again. CASSIUS: Hath Cassius lived To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus When grief and blood ill-tempered vexeth him? BRUTUS: When I spoke that, I was ill-tempered too. CASSIUS: Do you confess so much? Give me your hand. BRUTUS: And my heart too. CASSIUS: O Brutus! BRUTUS: What\\u2019s the matter? CASSIUS: Have not you love enough to bear with me When that rash humor which my mother gave me Makes me forgetful? BRUTUS: Yes, Cassius, and from henceforth When you are over-earnest with your Brutus, He\\u2019ll think your mother chides, and leave you so. POET: Let me go in to see the Generals. There is some grudge between \\u2019em; \\u2019tis not meet They be alone. LUCILIUS: You shall not come to them. POET: Nothing but death shall stay me. CASSIUS: How now, what\\u2019s the matter? POET: For shame, you generals, what do you mean? Love and be friends as two such men should be, For I have seen more years, I\\u2019m sure, than ye. CASSIUS: Ha, ha, how vilely doth this cynic rhyme! BRUTUS: Get you hence, sirrah! Saucy fellow, hence! CASSIUS: Bear with him, Brutus. \\u2019Tis his fashion. BRUTUS: I\\u2019ll know his humor when he knows his time. What should the wars do with these jigging fools?\\u2014 Companion, hence! CASSIUS: Away, away, be gone! BRUTUS: Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders Prepare to lodge their companies tonight. CASSIUS: And come yourselves, and bring Messala with you Immediately to us. BRUTUS: Lucius, a bowl of wine. CASSIUS: I did not think you could have been so angry. BRUTUS: O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs. CASSIUS: Of your philosophy you make no use If you give place to accidental evils. BRUTUS: No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead. CASSIUS: Ha? Portia? BRUTUS: She is dead. CASSIUS: How \\u2019scaped I killing when I crossed you so? O insupportable and touching loss! Upon what sickness? BRUTUS: Impatient of my absence, And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony Have made themselves so strong\\u2014for with her death That tidings came\\u2014with this she fell distract And, her attendants absent, swallowed fire. CASSIUS: And died so? BRUTUS: Even so. CASSIUS: O you immortal gods! BRUTUS: Speak no more of her.\\u2014Give me a bowl of wine.\\u2014 In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius. CASSIUS: My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.\\u2014 Fill, Lucius, till the wine o\\u2019erswell the cup; I cannot drink too much of Brutus\\u2019 love. BRUTUS: Come in, Titinius. Welcome, good Messala. Now sit we close about this taper here, And call in question our necessities. CASSIUS: Portia, art thou gone? BRUTUS: No more, I pray you.\\u2014 Messala, I have here receiv\\u00e8d letters That young Octavius and Mark Antony Come down upon us with a mighty power, Bending their expedition toward Philippi. MESSALA: Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor. BRUTUS: With what addition? MESSALA: That by proscription and bills of outlawry, Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus Have put to death an hundred senators. BRUTUS: Therein our letters do not well agree. Mine speak of seventy senators that died By their proscriptions, Cicero being one. CASSIUS: Cicero one? MESSALA: Cicero is dead, And by that order of proscription. Had you your letters from your wife, my lord? BRUTUS: No, Messala. MESSALA: Nor nothing in your letters writ of her? BRUTUS: Nothing, Messala. MESSALA: That methinks is strange. BRUTUS: Why ask you? Hear you aught of her in yours? MESSALA: No, my lord. BRUTUS: Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true. MESSALA: Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell, For certain she is dead, and by strange manner. BRUTUS: Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala. With meditating that she must die once, I have the patience to endure it now. MESSALA: Even so great men great losses should endure. CASSIUS: I have as much of this in art as you, But yet my nature could not bear it so. BRUTUS: Well, to our work alive. What do you think Of marching to Philippi presently? CASSIUS: I do not think it good. BRUTUS: Your reason? CASSIUS: This it is: \\u2019Tis better that the enemy seek us; So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers, Doing himself offense, whilst we, lying still, Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness. BRUTUS: Good reasons must of force give place to better. The people \\u2019twixt Philippi and this ground Do stand but in a forced affection, For they have grudged us contribution. The enemy, marching along by them, By them shall make a fuller number up, Come on refreshed, new-added, and encouraged, From which advantage shall we cut him off If at Philippi we do face him there, These people at our back. CASSIUS: Hear me, good brother\\u2014 BRUTUS: Under your pardon. You must note besides That we have tried the utmost of our friends, Our legions are brim full, our cause is ripe. The enemy increaseth every day; We, at the height, are ready to decline. There is a tide in the affairs of men Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune; Omitted, all the voyage of their life Is bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now afloat, And we must take the current when it serves Or lose our ventures. CASSIUS: Then, with your will, go on; We\\u2019ll along ourselves and meet them at Philippi. BRUTUS: The deep of night is crept upon our talk, And nature must obey necessity, Which we will niggard with a little rest. There is no more to say. CASSIUS: No more. Good night. BRUTUS: Early tomorrow will we rise and hence. BRUTUS: Lucius. BRUTUS: My gown. BRUTUS: Farewell, good Messala.\\u2014 Good night, Titinius.\\u2014Noble, noble Cassius, Good night and good repose.

What Antony shall speak I will protest He speaks by leave and by permission, And that we are contented Caesar shall Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies. It shall advantage more than do us wrong. CASSIUS: I know not what may fall. I like it not. BRUTUS: Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar\\u2019s body.

It is the bright day that brings forth the adder, And that craves wary walking. Crown him that, And then I grant we put a sting in him That at his will he may do danger with. Th\\u2019 abuse of greatness is when it disjoins Remorse from power. And, to speak truth of Caesar, I have not known when his affections swayed More than his reason. But \\u2019tis a common proof That lowliness is young ambition\\u2019s ladder, Whereto the climber-upward turns his face; But, when he once attains the upmost round, He then unto the ladder turns his back, Looks in the clouds, scorching the base degrees By which he did ascend. So Caesar may. Then, lest he may, prevent. And since the quarrel Will bear no color for the thing he is, Fashion it thus: that what he is, augmented, Would run to these and these extremities. And therefore think him as a serpent\\u2019s egg, Which, hatched, would, as his kind, grow mischievous, And kill him in the shell. LUCIUS: The taper burneth in your closet, sir.

Is not tomorrow, boy, the ides of March? LUCIUS: I know not, sir. BRUTUS: Look in the calendar, and bring me word. LUCIUS: I will, sir.

Go to the gate; somebody knocks. Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar, I have not slept. Between the acting of a dreadful thing And the first motion, all the interim is Like a phantasma or a hideous dream. The genius and the mortal instruments Are then in council, and the state of man, Like to a little kingdom, suffers then The nature of an insurrection. LUCIUS: Sir, \\u2019tis your brother Cassius at the door, Who doth desire to see you. BRUTUS: Is he alone? LUCIUS: No, sir. There are more with him. BRUTUS: Do you know them? LUCIUS: No, sir. Their hats are plucked about their ears, And half their faces buried in their cloaks, That by no means I may discover them By any mark of favor. BRUTUS: Let \\u2019em enter. They are the faction. O conspiracy, Sham\\u2019st thou to show thy dang\\u2019rous brow by night, When evils are most free? O, then, by day Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, conspiracy. Hide it in smiles and affability; For if thou path, thy native semblance on, Not Erebus itself were dim enough To hide thee from prevention. CASSIUS: I think we are too bold upon your rest. Good morrow, Brutus. Do we trouble you? BRUTUS: I have been up this hour, awake all night. Know I these men that come along with you? CASSIUS: Yes, every man of them; and no man here But honors you, and every one doth wish You had but that opinion of yourself Which every noble Roman bears of you. This is Trebonius. BRUTUS: He is welcome hither. CASSIUS: This, Decius Brutus. BRUTUS: He is welcome too. CASSIUS: This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber. BRUTUS They are all welcome. What watchful cares do interpose themselves Betwixt your eyes and night? CASSIUS: Shall I entreat a word? DECIUS: Here lies the east; doth not the day break here? CASCA: No. CINNA: O pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray lines That fret the clouds are messengers of day. CASCA: You shall confess that you are both deceived. Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises, Which is a great way growing on the south, Weighing the youthful season of the year. Some two months hence, up higher toward the north He first presents his fire, and the high east Stands, as the Capitol, directly here. BRUTUS: Give me your hands all over, one by one. CASSIUS: And let us swear our resolution. BRUTUS: No, not an oath. If not the face of men, The sufferance of our souls, the time\\u2019s abuse\\u2014 If these be motives weak, break off betimes, And every man hence to his idle bed. So let high-sighted tyranny range on Till each man drop by lottery. But if these\\u2014 As I am sure they do\\u2014bear fire enough To kindle cowards and to steel with valor The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen, What need we any spur but our own cause To prick us to redress? What other bond Than secret Romans that have spoke the word And will not palter? And what other oath Than honesty to honesty engaged That this shall be or we will fall for it? Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous, Old feeble carrions, and such suffering souls That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain The even virtue of our enterprise, Nor th\\u2019 insuppressive mettle of our spirits, To think that or our cause or our performance Did need an oath, when every drop of blood That every Roman bears, and nobly bears, Is guilty of a several bastardy If he do break the smallest particle Of any promise that hath passed from him. CASSIUS: But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him? I think he will stand very strong with us. CASCA: Let us not leave him out. CINNA: No, by no means. METELLUS: O, let us have him, for his silver hairs Will purchase us a good opinion And buy men\\u2019s voices to commend our deeds. It shall be said his judgment ruled our hands. Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear, But all be buried in his gravity. BRUTUS: O, name him not! Let us not break with him, For he will never follow anything That other men begin. CASSIUS: Then leave him out. CASCA: Indeed, he is not fit. DECIUS: Shall no man else be touched, but only Caesar? CASSIUS: Decius, well urged. I think it is not meet Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar, Should outlive Caesar. We shall find of him A shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means, If he improve them, may well stretch so far As to annoy us all; which to prevent, Let Antony and Caesar fall together. BRUTUS: Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius, To cut the head off and then hack the limbs, Like wrath in death and envy afterwards; For Antony is but a limb of Caesar. Let\\u2019s be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius. We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar, And in the spirit of men there is no blood. O, that we then could come by Caesar\\u2019s spirit And not dismember Caesar! But, alas, Caesar must bleed for it. And, gentle friends, Let\\u2019s kill him boldly, but not wrathfully. Let\\u2019s carve him as a dish fit for the gods, Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds. And let our hearts, as subtle masters do, Stir up their servants to an act of rage And after seem to chide \\u2019em. This shall make Our purpose necessary and not envious; Which so appearing to the common eyes, We shall be called purgers, not murderers. And for Mark Antony, think not of him, For he can do no more than Caesar\\u2019s arm When Caesar\\u2019s head is off. CASSIUS: Yet I fear him, For in the engrafted love he bears to Caesar\\u2014 BRUTUS: Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him. If he love Caesar, all that he can do Is to himself: take thought and die for Caesar. And that were much he should, for he is given To sports, to wildness, and much company. TREBONIUS: There is no fear in him. Let him not die, For he will live and laugh at this hereafter. BRUTUS: Peace, count the clock. CASSIUS: The clock hath stricken three. TREBONIUS: \\u2019Tis time to part. CASSIUS: But it is doubtful yet Whether Caesar will come forth today or no, For he is superstitious grown of late, Quite from the main opinion he held once Of fantasy, of dreams, and ceremonies. It may be these apparent prodigies, The unaccustomed terror of this night, And the persuasion of his augurers May hold him from the Capitol today. DECIUS: Never fear that. If he be so resolved, I can o\\u2019ersway him, for he loves to hear That unicorns may be betrayed with trees, And bears with glasses, elephants with holes, Lions with toils, and men with flatterers. But when I tell him he hates flatterers, He says he does, being then most flatter\\u00e8d. Let me work, For I can give his humor the true bent, And I will bring him to the Capitol. CASSIUS: Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him. BRUTUS: By the eighth hour, is that the uttermost? CINNA: Be that the uttermost, and fail not then. METELLUS: Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard, Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey. I wonder none of you have thought of him. BRUTUS: Now, good Metellus, go along by him. He loves me well, and I have given him reasons. Send him but hither, and I\\u2019ll fashion him. CASSIUS: The morning comes upon \\u2019s. We\\u2019ll leave you, Brutus. And, friends, disperse yourselves, but all remember What you have said, and show yourselves true Romans. BRUTUS: Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily. Let not our looks put on our purposes, But bear it, as our Roman actors do, With untired spirits and formal constancy. And so good morrow to you every one. BRUTUS: Boy! Lucius!\\u2014Fast asleep? It is no matter. Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber. Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies Which busy care draws in the brains of men. Therefore thou sleep\\u2019st so sound. PORTIA: Brutus, my lord. BRUTUS: Portia! What mean you? Wherefore rise you now?

ANTONY: Villains, you did not so when your vile daggers Hacked one another in the sides of Caesar. You showed your teeth like apes and fawned like hounds And bowed like bondmen, kissing Caesar\\u2019s feet, Whilst damn\\u00e8d Casca, like a cur, behind Struck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers! CASSIUS: Flatterers?\\u2014Now, Brutus, thank yourself! This tongue had not offended so today If Cassius might have ruled. OCTAVIUS: Come, come, the cause.

Never, till Caesar\\u2019s three and thirty wounds Be well avenged, or till another Caesar Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors. BRUTUS: Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors\\u2019 hands Unless thou bring\\u2019st them with thee. OCTAVIUS: So I hope. I was not born to die on Brutus\\u2019 sword. BRUTUS: O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain, Young man, thou couldst not die more honorable. CASSIUS: A peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honor, Joined with a masker and a reveler! ANTONY: Old Cassius still. OCTAVIUS: Come, Antony, away!\\u2014 Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth. If you dare fight today, come to the field; If not, when you have stomachs. CASSIUS: Why now, blow wind, swell billow, and swim bark! The storm is up, and all is on the hazard. BRUTUS: Ho, Lucilius, hark, a word with you. CASSIUS: Messala. MESSALA: What says my general? CASSIUS: Messala, This is my birthday, as this very day Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala. Be thou my witness that against my will (As Pompey was) am I compelled to set Upon one battle all our liberties. You know that I held Epicurus strong And his opinion. Now I change my mind And partly credit things that do presage. Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perched, Gorging and feeding from our soldiers\\u2019 hands, Who to Philippi here consorted us. This morning are they fled away and gone, And in their steads do ravens, crows, and kites Fly o\\u2019er our heads and downward look on us As we were sickly prey. Their shadows seem A canopy most fatal, under which Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost. MESSALA: Believe not so. CASSIUS: I but believe it partly, For I am fresh of spirit and resolved To meet all perils very constantly. BRUTUS: Even so, Lucilius. Now, most noble Brutus, The gods today stand friendly that we may, Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age. But since the affairs of men rests still incertain, Let\\u2019s reason with the worst that may befall. If we do lose this battle, then is this The very last time we shall speak together. What are you then determin\\u00e8d to do? BRUTUS: Even by the rule of that philosophy By which I did blame Cato for the death Which he did give himself (I know not how, But I do find it cowardly and vile, For fear of what might fall, so to prevent The time of life), arming myself with patience To stay the providence of some high powers That govern us below. CASSIUS: Then, if we lose this battle, You are contented to be led in triumph Thorough the streets of Rome? BRUTUS: No, Cassius, no. Think not, thou noble Roman, That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome. He bears too great a mind. But this same day Must end that work the ides of March begun. And whether we shall meet again, I know not. Therefore our everlasting farewell take. Forever and forever farewell, Cassius. If we do meet again, why we shall smile; If not, why then this parting was well made. CASSIUS: Forever and forever farewell, Brutus. If we do meet again, we\\u2019ll smile indeed; If not, \\u2019tis true this parting was well made. BRUTUS: Why then, lead on.\\u2014O, that a man might know The end of this day\\u2019s business ere it come! But it sufficeth that the day will end, And then the end is known.\\u2014Come ho, away!\\n\\n---\\n\\nSOURCE: act-4_scene-3.txt\\nAct:4 Scene:3 CASSIUS: That you have wronged me doth appear in this: You have condemned and noted Lucius Pella For taking bribes here of the Sardians, Wherein my letters, praying on his side Because I knew the man, was slighted off. BRUTUS: You wronged yourself to write in such a case. CASSIUS: In such a time as this it is not meet That every nice offense should bear his comment. BRUTUS: Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself Are much condemned to have an itching palm, To sell and mart your offices for gold To undeservers. CASSIUS: I an itching palm? You know that you are Brutus that speaks this, Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last. BRUTUS: The name of Cassius honors this corruption, And chastisement doth therefore hide his head. CASSIUS: Chastisement? BRUTUS: Remember March; the ides of March remember. Did not great Julius bleed for justice\\u2019 sake? What villain touched his body that did stab And not for justice? What, shall one of us That struck the foremost man of all this world But for supporting robbers, shall we now Contaminate our fingers with base bribes And sell the mighty space of our large honors For so much trash as may be grasp\\u00e8d thus? I had rather be a dog and bay the moon Than such a Roman. CASSIUS: Brutus, bait not me. I\\u2019ll not endure it. You forget yourself To hedge me in. I am a soldier, I, Older in practice, abler than yourself To make conditions. BRUTUS: Go to! You are not, Cassius. CASSIUS: I am. BRUTUS: I say you are not. CASSIUS: Urge me no more. I shall forget myself. Have mind upon your health. Tempt me no farther. BRUTUS: Away, slight man! CASSIUS: Is \\u2019t possible? BRUTUS: Hear me, for I will speak. Must I give way and room to your rash choler? Shall I be frighted when a madman stares? CASSIUS: O you gods, you gods, must I endure all this? BRUTUS: All this? Ay, more. Fret till your proud heart break. Go show your slaves how choleric you are And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge? Must I observe you? Must I stand and crouch Under your testy humor? By the gods, You shall digest the venom of your spleen Though it do split you. For, from this day forth, I\\u2019ll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter, When you are waspish. CASSIUS: Is it come to this? BRUTUS: You say you are a better soldier. Let it appear so, make your vaunting true, And it shall please me well. For mine own part, I shall be glad to learn of noble men. CASSIUS: You wrong me every way, you wrong me, Brutus. I said an elder soldier, not a better. Did I say \\u201cbetter\\u201d? BRUTUS: If you did, I care not. CASSIUS: When Caesar lived he durst not thus have moved me. BRUTUS: Peace, peace! You durst not so have tempted him. CASSIUS: I durst not? BRUTUS: No. CASSIUS: What? Durst not tempt him? BRUTUS: For your life you durst not. CASSIUS: Do not presume too much upon my love. I may do that I shall be sorry for. BRUTUS: You have done that you should be sorry for. There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats, For I am armed so strong in honesty That they pass by me as the idle wind, Which I respect not. I did send to you For certain sums of gold, which you denied me, For I can raise no money by vile means. By heaven, I had rather coin my heart And drop my blood for drachmas than to wring From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash By any indirection. I did send To you for gold to pay my legions, Which you denied me. Was that done like Cassius? Should I have answered Caius Cassius so? When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous To lock such rascal counters from his friends, Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts; Dash him to pieces! CASSIUS: I denied you not. BRUTUS: You did. CASSIUS: I did not. He was but a fool that brought My answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart. A friend should bear his friend\\u2019s infirmities, But Brutus makes mine greater than they are. BRUTUS: I do not, till you practice them on me. CASSIUS: You love me not. BRUTUS: I do not like your faults. CASSIUS: A friendly eye could never see such faults. BRUTUS: A flatterer\\u2019s would not, though they do appear As huge as high Olympus. CASSIUS: Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come! Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius, For Cassius is aweary of the world\\u2014 Hated by one he loves, braved by his brother, Checked like a bondman, all his faults observed, Set in a notebook, learned and conned by rote To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger, And here my naked breast; within, a heart Dearer than Pluto\\u2019s mine, richer than gold. If that thou be\\u2019st a Roman, take it forth. I that denied thee gold will give my heart. Strike as thou didst at Caesar, for I know When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better Than ever thou lovedst Cassius. BRUTUS: Sheathe your dagger. Be angry when you will, it shall have scope. Do what you will, dishonor shall be humor. O Cassius, you are yok\\u00e8d with a lamb That carries anger as the flint bears fire, Who, much enforc\\u00e8d, shows a hasty spark And straight is cold again. CASSIUS: Hath Cassius lived To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus When grief and blood ill-tempered vexeth him? BRUTUS: When I spoke that, I was ill-tempered too. CASSIUS: Do you confess so much? Give me your hand. BRUTUS: And my heart too. CASSIUS: O Brutus! BRUTUS: What\\u2019s the matter? CASSIUS: Have not you love enough to bear with me When that rash humor which my mother gave me Makes me forgetful? BRUTUS: Yes, Cassius, and from henceforth When you are over-earnest with your Brutus, He\\u2019ll think your mother chides, and leave you so. POET: Let me go in to see the Generals. There is some grudge between \\u2019em; \\u2019tis not meet They be alone. LUCILIUS: You shall not come to them. POET: Nothing but death shall stay me. CASSIUS: How now, what\\u2019s the matter? POET: For shame, you generals, what do you mean? Love and be friends as two such men should be, For I have seen more years, I\\u2019m sure, than ye. CASSIUS: Ha, ha, how vilely doth this cynic rhyme! BRUTUS: Get you hence, sirrah! Saucy fellow, hence! CASSIUS: Bear with him, Brutus. \\u2019Tis his fashion. BRUTUS: I\\u2019ll know his humor when he knows his time. What should the wars do with these jigging fools?\\u2014 Companion, hence! CASSIUS: Away, away, be gone! BRUTUS: Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders Prepare to lodge their companies tonight. CASSIUS: And come yourselves, and bring Messala with you Immediately to us. BRUTUS: Lucius, a bowl of wine. CASSIUS: I did not think you could have been so angry. BRUTUS: O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs. CASSIUS: Of your philosophy you make no use If you give place to accidental evils. BRUTUS: No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead. CASSIUS: Ha? Portia? BRUTUS: She is dead. CASSIUS: How \\u2019scaped I killing when I crossed you so? O insupportable and touching loss! Upon what sickness? BRUTUS: Impatient of my absence, And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony Have made themselves so strong\\u2014for with her death That tidings came\\u2014with this she fell distract And, her attendants absent, swallowed fire. CASSIUS: And died so? BRUTUS: Even so. CASSIUS: O you immortal gods! BRUTUS: Speak no more of her.\\u2014Give me a bowl of wine.\\u2014 In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius. CASSIUS: My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.\\u2014 Fill, Lucius, till the wine o\\u2019erswell the cup; I cannot drink too much of Brutus\\u2019 love. BRUTUS: Come in, Titinius. Welcome, good Messala. Now sit we close about this taper here, And call in question our necessities. CASSIUS: Portia, art thou gone? BRUTUS: No more, I pray you.\\u2014 Messala, I have here receiv\\u00e8d letters That young Octavius and Mark Antony Come down upon us with a mighty power, Bending their expedition toward Philippi. MESSALA: Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor. BRUTUS: With what addition? MESSALA: That by proscription and bills of outlawry, Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus Have put to death an hundred senators. BRUTUS: Therein our letters do not well agree. Mine speak of seventy senators that died By their proscriptions, Cicero being one. CASSIUS: Cicero one? MESSALA: Cicero is dead, And by that order of proscription. Had you your letters from your wife, my lord? BRUTUS: No, Messala. MESSALA: Nor nothing in your letters writ of her? BRUTUS: Nothing, Messala. MESSALA: That methinks is strange. BRUTUS: Why ask you? Hear you aught of her in yours? MESSALA: No, my lord. BRUTUS: Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true. MESSALA: Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell, For certain she is dead, and by strange manner. BRUTUS: Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala. With meditating that she must die once, I have the patience to endure it now. MESSALA: Even so great men great losses should endure. CASSIUS: I have as much of this in art as you, But yet my nature could not bear it so. BRUTUS: Well, to our work alive. What do you think Of marching to Philippi presently? CASSIUS: I do not think it good. BRUTUS: Your reason? CASSIUS: This it is: \\u2019Tis better that the enemy seek us; So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers, Doing himself offense, whilst we, lying still, Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness. BRUTUS: Good reasons must of force give place to better. The people \\u2019twixt Philippi and this ground Do stand but in a forced affection, For they have grudged us contribution. The enemy, marching along by them, By them shall make a fuller number up, Come on refreshed, new-added, and encouraged, From which advantage shall we cut him off If at Philippi we do face him there, These people at our back. CASSIUS: Hear me, good brother\\u2014 BRUTUS: Under your pardon. You must note besides That we have tried the utmost of our friends, Our legions are brim full, our cause is ripe. The enemy increaseth every day; We, at the height, are ready to decline. There is a tide in the affairs of men Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune; Omitted, all the voyage of their life Is bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now afloat, And we must take the current when it serves Or lose our ventures. CASSIUS: Then, with your will, go on; We\\u2019ll along ourselves and meet them at Philippi. BRUTUS: The deep of night is crept upon our talk, And nature must obey necessity, Which we will niggard with a little rest. There is no more to say. CASSIUS: No more. Good night. BRUTUS: Early tomorrow will we rise and hence. BRUTUS: Lucius. BRUTUS: My gown. BRUTUS: Farewell, good Messala.\\u2014 Good night, Titinius.\\u2014Noble, noble Cassius, Good night and good repose.

CASSIUS: Messala, This is my birthday, as this very day Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala. Be thou my witness that against my will (As Pompey was) am I compelled to set Upon one battle all our liberties. You know that I held Epicurus strong And his opinion. Now I change my mind And partly credit things that do presage. Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perched, Gorging and feeding from our soldiers\\u2019 hands, Who to Philippi here consorted us. This morning are they fled away and gone, And in their steads do ravens, crows, and kites Fly o\\u2019er our heads and downward look on us As we were sickly prey. Their shadows seem A canopy most fatal, under which Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost. MESSALA: Believe not so. CASSIUS: I but believe it partly, For I am fresh of spirit and resolved To meet all perils very constantly. BRUTUS: Even so, Lucilius. Now, most noble Brutus, The gods today stand friendly that we may, Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age. But since the affairs of men rests still incertain, Let\\u2019s reason with the worst that may befall. If we do lose this battle, then is this The very last time we shall speak together. What are you then determin\\u00e8d to do? BRUTUS: Even by the rule of that philosophy By which I did blame Cato for the death Which he did give himself (I know not how, But I do find it cowardly and vile, For fear of what might fall, so to prevent The time of life), arming myself with patience To stay the providence of some high powers That govern us below. CASSIUS: Then, if we lose this battle, You are contented to be led in triumph Thorough the streets of Rome? BRUTUS: No, Cassius, no. Think not, thou noble Roman, That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome. He bears too great a mind. But this same day Must end that work the ides of March begun. And whether we shall meet again, I know not. Therefore our everlasting farewell take. Forever and forever farewell, Cassius. If we do meet again, why we shall smile; If not, why then this parting was well made. CASSIUS: Forever and forever farewell, Brutus.

    "question": "How does Shakespeare use the concept of \u201chonor\u201d to shape the moral conflict between Brutus and the other conspirators?",
    "ideal answer": "Shakespeare shows honor as Brutus\u2019s motivation and flaw, contrasting his moral reasoning with Cassius\u2019s ambition.",
    "model_answer": {"answer": "In William Shakespeare's play 'Julius Caesar,' the concept of honor plays a significant role in shaping the moral conflict between Brutus and the other conspirators. Honor is a complex and multifaceted idea that encompasses notions of reputation, duty, loyalty, and personal integrity.\\n\\nBrutus, in particular, is driven by a desire to uphold his own sense of honor, which he believes is compromised by Caesar's growing power and perceived tyranny. He sees himself as a defender of Rome's traditional values and institutions, and he believes that Caesar's ambition threatens the very fabric of their society. Brutus's honor is rooted in his commitment to the ideals of the Roman Republic, and he sees himself as a champion of these principles.\\n\\nHowever, this sense of honor also blinds Brutus to the consequences of his actions. He is willing to sacrifice his own life and the lives of others in order to fulfill what he believes is his duty to Rome. This selfless dedication to his cause is admirable, but it also leads him to rationalize the brutal murder of Caesar, which ultimately proves to be a fatal mistake.\\n\\nThe other conspirators, including Cassius and Decius Brutus, are also motivated by a desire to uphold their own sense of honor. However, their motivations are more self-serving and driven by personal ambition rather than a genuine commitment to Rome's ideals. They see themselves as virtuous and noble, but their actions are ultimately driven by a desire for power and prestige.\\n\\nShakespeare uses the concept of honor to highlight the complexities and nuances of human motivation. He shows how even well-intentioned individuals can be swayed by personal ambition and pride, leading them to compromise their values and principles. At the same time, he also highlights the importance of genuine commitment to a cause, as embodied by Brutus's selfless dedication to Rome.\\n\\nThe play ultimately suggests that true honor is not about personal glory or recognition, but rather about living up to one's principles and values in the face of adversity. Brutus's tragic downfall serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of allowing personal ambition to cloud one's judgment, while also highlighting the importance of staying true to oneself and one's ideals.\\n\\nIn contrast, Antony's character represents a more nuanced understanding of honor. He is driven by a desire to protect Rome and its people from Caesar's perceived tyranny, but he also acknowledges his own limitations and vulnerabilities. Unlike Brutus, Antony is willing to listen to others and consider alternative perspectives, rather than relying solely on his own sense of honor.\\n\\nThrough the character of Antony, Shakespeare offers an alternative vision of honor that emphasizes empathy, compassion, and humility. This vision is rooted in a recognition of human fallibility and the importance of seeking guidance from others, rather than relying solely on one's own judgment.\\n\\nOverall, the concept of honor plays a central role in shaping the moral conflict between Brutus and the other conspirators.

ARTEMIDORUS: Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly. CAESAR: What, is the fellow mad? PUBLIUS: Sirrah, give place. CASSIUS: What, urge you your petitions in the street? Come to the Capitol. POPILIUS: I wish your enterprise today may thrive. CASSIUS: What enterprise, Popilius? POPILIUS: Fare you well. BRUTUS: What said Popilius Lena? CASSIUS: He wished today our enterprise might thrive. I fear our purpose is discover\\u00e8d. BRUTUS: Look how he makes to Caesar. Mark him. CASSIUS: Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.\\u2014 Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known, Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back, For I will slay myself. BRUTUS: Cassius, be constant. Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes, For look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change. CASSIUS: Trebonius knows his time, for look you, Brutus, He draws Mark Antony out of the way. DECIUS: Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go And presently prefer his suit to Caesar. BRUTUS: He is addressed. Press near and second him. CINNA: Casca, you are the first that rears your hand. CAESAR: Are we all ready? What is now amiss That Caesar and his Senate must redress? METELLUS: Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar, Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat An humble heart. CAESAR: I must prevent thee, Cimber. These couchings and these lowly courtesies Might fire the blood of ordinary men And turn preordinance and first decree Into the law of children. Be not fond To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood That will be thawed from the true quality With that which melteth fools\\u2014I mean sweet words, Low-crook\\u00e8d curtsies, and base spaniel fawning. Thy brother by decree is banish\\u00e8d. If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him, I spurn thee like a cur out of my way. Know: Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause Will he be satisfied. METELLUS: Is there no voice more worthy than my own To sound more sweetly in great Caesar\\u2019s ear For the repealing of my banished brother? BRUTUS: I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar, Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may Have an immediate freedom of repeal. CAESAR: What, Brutus? CASSIUS: Pardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon! As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber. CAESAR: I could be well moved, if I were as you. If I could pray to move, prayers would move me. But I am constant as the Northern Star, Of whose true fixed and resting quality There is no fellow in the firmament. The skies are painted with unnumbered sparks; They are all fire, and every one doth shine. But there\\u2019s but one in all doth hold his place. So in the world: \\u2019tis furnished well with men, And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive. Yet in the number I do know but one That unassailable holds on his rank, Unshaked of motion; and that I am he Let me a little show it, even in this: That I was constant Cimber should be banished And constant do remain to keep him so. CINNA: O Caesar\\u2014 CAESAR: Hence. Wilt thou lift up Olympus? DECIUS: Great Caesar\\u2014 CAESAR: Doth not Brutus bootless kneel? CASCA: Speak, hands, for me!

CASSIUS: Some to the common pulpits and cry out \\u201cLiberty, freedom, and enfranchisement.\\u201d BRUTUS: People and Senators, be not affrighted. Fly not; stand still. Ambition\\u2019s debt is paid. CASCA: Go to the pulpit, Brutus. DECIUS: And Cassius too. BRUTUS: Where\\u2019s Publius? CINNA: Here, quite confounded with this mutiny. METELLUS: Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar\\u2019s Should chance\\u2014 BRUTUS: Talk not of standing.\\u2014Publius, good cheer. There is no harm intended to your person, Nor to no Roman else. So tell them, Publius. CASSIUS: And leave us, Publius, lest that the people, Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief. BRUTUS: Do so, and let no man abide this deed But we the doers. CASSIUS: Where is Antony? TREBONIUS: Fled to his house amazed. Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run As it were doomsday. BRUTUS: Fates, we will know your pleasures. That we shall die we know; \\u2019tis but the time, And drawing days out, that men stand upon. CASCA: Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life Cuts off so many years of fearing death. BRUTUS: Grant that, and then is death a benefit. So are we Caesar\\u2019s friends, that have abridged His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop, And let us bathe our hands in Caesar\\u2019s blood Up to the elbows and besmear our swords. Then walk we forth, even to the marketplace, And, waving our red weapons o\\u2019er our heads, Let\\u2019s all cry \\u201cPeace, freedom, and liberty!\\u201d CASSIUS: Stoop then, and wash. How many ages hence Shall this our lofty scene be acted over In states unborn and accents yet unknown! BRUTUS: How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport, That now on Pompey\\u2019s basis lies along No worthier than the dust! CASSIUS: So oft as that shall be, So often shall the knot of us be called The men that gave their country liberty. DECIUS: What, shall we forth? CASSIUS: Ay, every man away. Brutus shall lead, and we will grace his heels With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome. BRUTUS: Soft, who comes here? A friend of Antony\\u2019s. SERVANT: Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel. Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down, And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say: Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest; Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving. Say, I love Brutus, and I honor him; Say, I feared Caesar, honored him, and loved him. If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony May safely come to him and be resolved How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death, Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead So well as Brutus living, but will follow The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus Thorough the hazards of this untrod state With all true faith. So says my master Antony. BRUTUS: Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman. I never thought him worse. Tell him, so please him come unto this place, He shall be satisfied and, by my honor, Depart untouched. SERVANT: I\\u2019ll fetch him presently. BRUTUS: I know that we shall have him well to friend. CASSIUS: I wish we may; but yet have I a mind That fears him much, and my misgiving still Falls shrewdly to the purpose. BRUTUS: But here comes Antony.\\u2014Welcome, Mark Antony! ANTONY: O mighty Caesar, dost thou lie so low? Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.\\u2014 I know not, gentlemen, what you intend, Who else must be let blood, who else is rank. If I myself, there is no hour so fit As Caesar\\u2019s death\\u2019s hour, nor no instrument Of half that worth as those your swords made rich With the most noble blood of all this world. I do beseech you, if you bear me hard, Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke, Fulfill your pleasure. Live a thousand years, I shall not find myself so apt to die; No place will please me so, no mean of death, As here by Caesar, and by you cut off, The choice and master spirits of this age. BRUTUS: O Antony, beg not your death of us! Though now we must appear bloody and cruel, As by our hands and this our present act You see we do, yet see you but our hands And this the bleeding business they have done. Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful; And pity to the general wrong of Rome (As fire drives out fire, so pity pity) Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part, To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony. Our arms in strength of malice, and our hearts Of brothers\\u2019 temper, do receive you in With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence. CASSIUS: Your voice shall be as strong as any man\\u2019s In the disposing of new dignities. BRUTUS: Only be patient till we have appeased The multitude, beside themselves with fear; And then we will deliver you the cause Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him, Have thus proceeded. ANTONY: I doubt not of your wisdom. Let each man render me his bloody hand. First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you.\\u2014 Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand.\\u2014 Now, Decius Brutus, yours;\\u2014now yours, Metellus;\\u2014 Yours, Cinna;\\u2014and, my valiant Casca, yours;\\u2014 Though last, not least in love, yours, good Trebonius.\\u2014 Gentlemen all\\u2014alas, what shall I say? My credit now stands on such slippery ground That one of two bad ways you must conceit me, Either a coward or a flatterer.\\u2014 That I did love thee, Caesar, O, \\u2019tis true! If then thy spirit look upon us now, Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death To see thy Antony making his peace, Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes\\u2014 Most noble!\\u2014in the presence of thy corpse? Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds, Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood, It would become me better than to close In terms of friendship with thine enemies. Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bayed, brave hart, Here didst thou fall, and here thy hunters stand Signed in thy spoil and crimsoned in thy Lethe. O world, thou wast the forest to this hart, And this indeed, O world, the heart of thee. How like a deer strucken by many princes Dost thou here lie! CASSIUS: Mark Antony\\u2014 ANTONY: Pardon me, Caius Cassius. The enemies of Caesar shall say this; Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty. CASSIUS: I blame you not for praising Caesar so. But what compact mean you to have with us? Will you be pricked in number of our friends, Or shall we on and not depend on you? ANTONY: Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed Swayed from the point by looking down on Caesar. Friends am I with you all and love you all, Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous. BRUTUS: Or else were this a savage spectacle. Our reasons are so full of good regard That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar, You should be satisfied. ANTONY: That\\u2019s all I seek; And am, moreover, suitor that I may Produce his body to the marketplace, And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend, Speak in the order of his funeral. BRUTUS: You shall, Mark Antony. CASSIUS: Brutus, a word with you. CASSIUS: You know not what you do. Do not consent That Antony speak in his funeral. Know you how much the people may be moved By that which he will utter? BRUTUS: By your pardon, I will myself into the pulpit first And show the reason of our Caesar\\u2019s death. What Antony shall speak I will protest He speaks by leave and by permission, And that we are contented Caesar shall Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies. It shall advantage more than do us wrong. CASSIUS: I know not what may fall. I like it not.\\n\\n---\\n\\nSOURCE: act-3_scene-2.txt\\nAct:3 Scene:2 PLEBEIANS: We will be satisfied! Let us be satisfied! BRUTUS: Then follow me and give me audience, friends.\\u2014 Cassius, go you into the other street And part the numbers.\\u2014Those that will hear me speak, let \\u2019em stay here; Those that will follow Cassius, go with him; And public reasons shall be render\\u00e8d Of Caesar\\u2019s death. FIRST PLEBEIAN: I will hear Brutus speak. SECOND PLEBEIAN: I will hear Cassius, and compare their reasons When severally we hear them render\\u00e8d. THIRD PLEBEIAN: The noble Brutus is ascended. Silence. BRUTUS: Be patient till the last. Romans, countrymen, and lovers, hear me for my cause, and be silent that you may hear. Believe me for mine honor, and have respect to mine honor that you may believe. Censure me in your wisdom, and awake your senses that you may the better judge. If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar\\u2019s, to him I say that Brutus\\u2019 love to Caesar was no less than his. If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer: not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living, and die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live all freemen? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him. As he was fortunate, I rejoice at it. As he was valiant, I honor him. But, as he was ambitious, I slew him. There is tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor for his valor, and death for his ambition. Who is here so base that would be a bondman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so vile that will not love his country? If any, speak, for him have I offended. I pause for a reply. PLEBEIANS: None, Brutus, none. BRUTUS: Then none have I offended. I have done no more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol, his glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy, nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered death. BRUTUS: Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, though he had no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying\\u2014a place in the commonwealth\\u2014as which of you shall not? With this I depart: that, as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself when it shall please my country to need my death. PLEBEIANS: Live, Brutus, live, live! FIRST PLEBEIAN: Bring him with triumph home unto his house. SECOND PLEBEIAN: Give him a statue with his ancestors. THIRD PLEBEIAN: Let him be Caesar. FOURTH PLEBEIAN: Caesar\\u2019s better parts Shall be crowned in Brutus. FIRST PLEBEIAN: We\\u2019ll bring him to his house with shouts and clamors. BRUTUS: My countrymen\\u2014 SECOND PLEBEIAN: Peace, silence! Brutus speaks. FIRST PLEBEIAN: Peace, ho! BRUTUS: Good countrymen, let me depart alone, And, for my sake, stay here with Antony. Do grace to Caesar\\u2019s corpse, and grace his speech Tending to Caesar\\u2019s glories, which Mark Antony (By our permission) is allowed to make. I do entreat you, not a man depart, Save I alone, till Antony have spoke. FIRST PLEBEIAN: Stay, ho, and let us hear Mark Antony! THIRD PLEBEIAN: Let him go up into the public chair. PLEBEIANS: We\\u2019ll hear him.\\u2014Noble Antony, go up. ANTONY: For Brutus\\u2019 sake, I am beholding to you. FOURTH PLEBEIAN: What does he say of Brutus? THIRD PLEBEIAN: He says for Brutus\\u2019 sake He finds himself beholding to us all. FOURTH PLEBEIAN: \\u2019Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here. FIRST PLEBEIAN: This Caesar was a tyrant. THIRD PLEBEIAN: Nay, that\\u2019s certain. We are blest that Rome is rid of him. SECOND PLEBEIAN: Peace, let us hear what Antony can say. ANTONY: You gentle Romans\\u2014 PLEBEIANS: Peace, ho! Let us hear him. ANTONY: Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears. I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. The evil that men do lives after them; The good is oft interr\\u00e8d with their bones. So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus Hath told you Caesar was ambitious. If it were so, it was a grievous fault, And grievously hath Caesar answered it. Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest (For Brutus is an honorable man; So are they all, all honorable men), Come I to speak in Caesar\\u2019s funeral. He was my friend, faithful and just to me, But Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man. He hath brought many captives home to Rome, Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill. Did this in Caesar seem ambitious? When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept; Ambition should be made of sterner stuff. Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man. You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown, Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And sure he is an honorable man. I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, But here I am to speak what I do know. You all did love him once, not without cause. What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for him?\\u2014 O judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, And men have lost their reason!\\u2014Bear with me; My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar, And I must pause till it come back to me. FIRST PLEBEIAN: Methinks there is much reason in his sayings. SECOND PLEBEIAN: If thou consider rightly of the matter, Caesar has had great wrong. THIRD PLEBEIAN: Has he, masters? I fear there will a worse come in his place. FOURTH PLEBEIAN: Marked you his words? He would not take the crown; Therefore \\u2019tis certain he was not ambitious. FIRST PLEBEIAN: If it be found so, some will dear abide it. SECOND PLEBEIAN: Poor soul, his eyes are red as fire with weeping. THIRD PLEBEIAN: There\\u2019s not a nobler man in Rome than Antony. FOURTH PLEBEIAN: Now mark him. He begins again to speak. ANTONY: But yesterday the word of Caesar might Have stood against the world. Now lies he there, And none so poor to do him reverence. O masters, if I were disposed to stir Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage, I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong, Who, you all know, are honorable men. I will not do them wrong. I rather choose To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you, Than I will wrong such honorable men. But here\\u2019s a parchment with the seal of Caesar. I found it in his closet. \\u2019Tis his will. Let but the commons hear this testament, Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read, And they would go and kiss dead Caesar\\u2019s wounds And dip their napkins in his sacred blood\\u2014 Yea, beg a hair of him for memory And, dying, mention it within their wills, Bequeathing it as a rich legacy Unto their issue. FOURTH PLEBEIAN: We\\u2019ll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony. PLEBEIANS: The will, the will! We will hear Caesar\\u2019s will. ANTONY: Have patience, gentle friends. I must not read it. It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you. You are not wood, you are not stones, but men. And, being men, hearing the will of Caesar, It will inflame you; it will make you mad. \\u2019Tis good you know not that you are his heirs, For if you should, O, what would come of it? FOURTH PLEBEIAN: Read the will! We\\u2019ll hear it, Antony. PLEBEIANS: You shall read us the will, Caesar\\u2019s will. ANTONY: Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile? I have o\\u2019ershot myself to tell you of it. I fear I wrong the honorable men Whose daggers have stabbed Caesar. I do fear it. FOURTH PLEBEIAN: They were traitors. Honorable men? PLEBEIANS: The will! The testament! SECOND PLEBEIAN: They were villains, murderers. The will! Read the will. ANTONY: You will compel me, then, to read the will? Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar, And let me show you him that made the will. Shall I descend? And will you give me leave? PLEBEIANS: Come down. SECOND PLEBEIAN: Descend. THIRD PLEBEIAN: You shall have leave. FOURTH PLEBEIAN: A ring; stand round. FIRST PLEBEIAN: Stand from the hearse. Stand from the body. SECOND PLEBEIAN: Room for Antony, most noble Antony. ANTONY: Nay, press not so upon me. Stand far off. PLEBEIANS: Stand back! Room! Bear back! ANTONY: If you have tears, prepare to shed them now. You all do know this mantle. I remember The first time ever Caesar put it on. \\u2019Twas on a summer\\u2019s evening in his tent, That day he overcame the Nervii. Look, in this place ran Cassius\\u2019 dagger through. See what a rent the envious Casca made. Through this the well-belov\\u00e8d Brutus stabbed, And, as he plucked his curs\\u00e8d steel away, Mark how the blood of Caesar followed it, As rushing out of doors to be resolved If Brutus so unkindly knocked or no; For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar\\u2019s angel. Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him! This was the most unkindest cut of all. For when the noble Caesar saw him stab, Ingratitude, more strong than traitors\\u2019 arms, Quite vanquished him. Then burst his mighty heart, And, in his mantle muffling up his face, Even at the base of Pompey\\u2019s statue (Which all the while ran blood) great Caesar fell. O, what a fall was there, my countrymen! Then I and you and all of us fell down, Whilst bloody treason flourished over us. O, now you weep, and I perceive you feel The dint of pity. These are gracious drops. Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold Here is himself, marred as you see with traitors. FIRST PLEBEIAN: O piteous spectacle! SECOND PLEBEIAN: O noble Caesar! THIRD PLEBEIAN: O woeful day! FOURTH PLEBEIAN: O traitors, villains! FIRST PLEBEIAN: O most bloody sight! SECOND PLEBEIAN: We will be revenged. PLEBEIANS: Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay! Let not a traitor live! ANTONY: Stay, countrymen. FIRST PLEBEIAN: Peace there! Hear the noble Antony. SECOND PLEBEIAN: We\\u2019ll hear him, we\\u2019ll follow him, we\\u2019ll die with him. ANTONY: Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up To such a sudden flood of mutiny. They that have done this deed are honorable. What private griefs they have, alas, I know not, That made them do it. They are wise and honorable And will no doubt with reasons answer you. I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts. I am no orator, as Brutus is, But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man That love my friend, and that they know full well That gave me public leave to speak of him. For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth, Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech To stir men\\u2019s blood. I only speak right on. I tell you that which you yourselves do know, Show you sweet Caesar\\u2019s wounds, poor poor dumb mouths, And bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus, And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue In every wound of Caesar that should move The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny. PLEBEIANS: We\\u2019ll mutiny. FIRST PLEBEIAN: We\\u2019ll burn the house of Brutus. THIRD PLEBEIAN: Away then. Come, seek the conspirators. ANTONY: Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak. PLEBEIANS: Peace, ho! Hear Antony, most noble Antony! ANTONY: Why, friends, you go to do you know not what. Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves? Alas, you know not. I must tell you then. You have forgot the will I told you of."}

What is the difference? Many ordinary readers assume that there is a single text for the plays: what Shakespeare wrote. But Shakespeare\\u2019s plays were not published the way modern novels or plays are published today: as a single, authoritative text. In some cases, the plays have come down to us in multiple published versions, represented by various Quartos (Qq) and by the great collection put together by his colleagues in 1623, called the First Folio (F). There are, for example, three very different versions of Hamlet, two of King Lear, Henry V, Romeo and Juliet, and others. Editors choose which version to use as their base text, and then amend that text with words, lines or speech prefixes from the other versions that, in their judgment, make for a better or more accurate text. Other editorial decisions involve choices about whether an unfamiliar word could be understood in light of other writings of the period or whether it should be changed; decisions about words that made it into Shakespeare\\u2019s text by accident through four hundred years of printings and misprinting; and even decisions based on cultural preference and taste. When the Moby\\u2122 Text was created, for example, it was deemed \\u201cimproper\\u201d and \\u201cindecent\\u201d for Miranda to chastise Caliban for having attempted to rape her. (See The Tempest, 1.2: \\u201cAbhorred slave,/Which any print of goodness wilt not take,/Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee\\u2026\\u201d). All Shakespeare editors at the time took the speech away from her and gave it to her father, Prospero. The editors of the Moby\\u2122 Shakespeare produced their text long before scholars fully understood the proper grounds on which to make the thousands of decisions that Shakespeare editors face. The Folger Library Shakespeare Editions, on which the Folger Digital Texts depend, make this editorial process as nearly transparent as is possible, in contrast to older texts, like the Moby\\u2122, which hide editorial interventions. The reader of the Folger Shakespeare knows where the text has been altered because editorial interventions are signaled by square brackets (for example, from Othello: \\u201c If she in chains of magic were not bound, \\u201d), half-square brackets (for example, from Henry V: \\u201cWith blood and sword and fire to win your p , y y right,\\u201d), or angle brackets (for example, from Hamlet: \\u201cO farewell, honest soldier. Who hath relieved/you?\\u201d). At any point in the text, you can hover your cursor over a bracket for more information. Because the Folger Digital Texts are edited in accord with twenty-first century knowledge about Shakespeare\\u2019s texts, the Folger here provides them to readers, scholars, teachers, actors, directors, and students, free of charge, confident of their quality as texts of the plays and pleased to be able to make this contribution to the study and enjoyment of Shakespeare. Synopsis Caesar\\u2019s assassination is just the halfway point of Julius Caesar. The first part of the play leads to his death; the second portrays the consequences. As the action begins, Rome prepares for Caesar\\u2019s triumphal entrance. Brutus, Caesar\\u2019s friend and ally, fears that Caesar will become king, destroying the republic. Cassius and others convince Brutus to join a conspiracy to kill Caesar. On the day of the assassination, Caesar plans to stay home at the urging of his wife, Calphurnia. A conspirator, Decius Brutus, persuades him to go to the Senate with the other conspirators and his friend, Mark Antony. At the Senate, the conspirators stab Caesar to death. Antony uses a funeral oration to turn the citizens of Rome against them. Brutus and Cassius escape as Antony joins forces with Octavius Caesar. Encamped with their armies, Brutus and Cassius quarrel, then agree to march on Antony and Octavius. In the battle which follows, Cassius, misled by erroneous reports of loss, persuades a slave to kill him; Brutus\\u2019s army is defeated. Brutus commits suicide, praised by Antony as \\u201cthe noblest Roman of them all.\\u201d Title: Julius Caesar Author: William Shakespeare Release date: November 1, 1998 [eBook #1522] Most recently updated: September 19, 2025 Language: English Credits: the PG Shakespeare Team, a team of about twenty Project Gutenberg volunteers *** START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK JULIUS CAESAR *** THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR by William Shakespeare Contents ACT-I Scene-I.

By appealing to the emotions and values of the Roman people, Antony successfully galvanizes their outrage and demands for revenge against the conspirators. In contrast, Brutus's rational explanations and justifications, though well-intentioned, fail to resonate with the mob, who are driven more by passion than reason (ANTONY: 'Why, friends, you go to do you know not what...').

SOOTHSAYER: Ay, Caesar, but not gone. ARTEMIDORUS: Hail, Caesar. Read this schedule. DECIUS: Trebonius doth desire you to o\\u2019erread, At your best leisure, this his humble suit. ARTEMIDORUS: O Caesar, read mine first, for mine\\u2019s a suit That touches Caesar nearer. Read it, great Caesar. CAESAR: What touches us ourself shall be last served. ARTEMIDORUS: Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly. CAESAR: What, is the fellow mad? PUBLIUS: Sirrah, give place. CASSIUS: What, urge you your petitions in the street? Come to the Capitol. POPILIUS: I wish your enterprise today may thrive. CASSIUS: What enterprise, Popilius? POPILIUS: Fare you well. BRUTUS: What said Popilius Lena? CASSIUS: He wished today our enterprise might thrive. I fear our purpose is discover\\u00e8d. BRUTUS: Look how he makes to Caesar. Mark him. CASSIUS: Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.\\u2014 Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known, Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back, For I will slay myself. BRUTUS: Cassius, be constant. Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes, For look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change. CASSIUS: Trebonius knows his time, for look you, Brutus, He draws Mark Antony out of the way. DECIUS: Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go And presently prefer his suit to Caesar. BRUTUS: He is addressed. Press near and second him. CINNA: Casca, you are the first that rears your hand. CAESAR: Are we all ready? What is now amiss That Caesar and his Senate must redress? METELLUS: Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar, Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat An humble heart. CAESAR: I must prevent thee, Cimber. These couchings and these lowly courtesies Might fire the blood of ordinary men And turn preordinance and first decree Into the law of children. Be not fond To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood That will be thawed from the true quality With that which melteth fools\\u2014I mean sweet words, Low-crook\\u00e8d curtsies, and base spaniel fawning. Thy brother by decree is banish\\u00e8d. If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him, I spurn thee like a cur out of my way. Know: Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause Will he be satisfied. METELLUS: Is there no voice more worthy than my own To sound more sweetly in great Caesar\\u2019s ear For the repealing of my banished brother? BRUTUS: I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar, Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may Have an immediate freedom of repeal. CAESAR: What, Brutus? CASSIUS: Pardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon! As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber. CAESAR: I could be well moved, if I were as you. If I could pray to move, prayers would move me. But I am constant as the Northern Star, Of whose true fixed and resting quality There is no fellow in the firmament. The skies are painted with unnumbered sparks; They are all fire, and every one doth shine. But there\\u2019s but one in all doth hold his place. So in the world: \\u2019tis furnished well with men, And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive. Yet in the number I do know but one That unassailable holds on his rank, Unshaked of motion; and that I am he Let me a little show it, even in this: That I was constant Cimber should be banished And constant do remain to keep him so. CINNA: O Caesar\\u2014 CAESAR: Hence. Wilt thou lift up Olympus? DECIUS: Great Caesar\\u2014 CAESAR: Doth not Brutus bootless kneel? CASCA: Speak, hands, for me! CAESAR: Et tu, Brut\\u00e8?\\u2014Then fall, Caesar. CINNA: Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead! Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets. CASSIUS: Some to the common pulpits and cry out \\u201cLiberty, freedom, and enfranchisement.\\u201d BRUTUS: People and Senators, be not affrighted. Fly not; stand still. Ambition\\u2019s debt is paid. CASCA: Go to the pulpit, Brutus. DECIUS: And Cassius too. BRUTUS: Where\\u2019s Publius? CINNA: Here, quite confounded with this mutiny. METELLUS: Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar\\u2019s Should chance\\u2014 BRUTUS: Talk not of standing.\\u2014Publius, good cheer. There is no harm intended to your person, Nor to no Roman else. So tell them, Publius. CASSIUS: And leave us, Publius, lest that the people, Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief. BRUTUS: Do so, and let no man abide this deed But we the doers. CASSIUS: Where is Antony? TREBONIUS: Fled to his house amazed. Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run As it were doomsday. BRUTUS: Fates, we will know your pleasures. That we shall die we know; \\u2019tis but the time, And drawing days out, that men stand upon. CASCA: Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life Cuts off so many years of fearing death. BRUTUS: Grant that, and then is death a benefit. So are we Caesar\\u2019s friends, that have abridged His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop, And let us bathe our hands in Caesar\\u2019s blood Up to the elbows and besmear our swords. Then walk we forth, even to the marketplace, And, waving our red weapons o\\u2019er our heads, Let\\u2019s all cry \\u201cPeace, freedom, and liberty!\\u201d CASSIUS: Stoop then, and wash. How many ages hence Shall this our lofty scene be acted over In states unborn and accents yet unknown! BRUTUS: How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport, That now on Pompey\\u2019s basis lies along No worthier than the dust! CASSIUS: So oft as that shall be, So often shall the knot of us be called The men that gave their country liberty. DECIUS: What, shall we forth? CASSIUS: Ay, every man away. Brutus shall lead, and we will grace his heels With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome. BRUTUS: Soft, who comes here? A friend of Antony\\u2019s. SERVANT: Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel. Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down, And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say: Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest; Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving. Say, I love Brutus, and I honor him; Say, I feared Caesar, honored him, and loved him. If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony May safely come to him and be resolved How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death, Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead So well as Brutus living, but will follow The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus Thorough the hazards of this untrod state With all true faith. So says my master Antony. BRUTUS: Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman. I never thought him worse. Tell him, so please him come unto this place, He shall be satisfied and, by my honor, Depart untouched. SERVANT: I\\u2019ll fetch him presently. BRUTUS: I know that we shall have him well to friend. CASSIUS: I wish we may; but yet have I a mind That fears him much, and my misgiving still Falls shrewdly to the purpose. BRUTUS: But here comes Antony.\\u2014Welcome, Mark Antony! ANTONY: O mighty Caesar, dost thou lie so low? Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.\\u2014 I know not, gentlemen, what you intend, Who else must be let blood, who else is rank. If I myself, there is no hour so fit As Caesar\\u2019s death\\u2019s hour, nor no instrument Of half that worth as those your swords made rich With the most noble blood of all this world. I do beseech you, if you bear me hard, Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke, Fulfill your pleasure. Live a thousand years, I shall not find myself so apt to die; No place will please me so, no mean of death, As here by Caesar, and by you cut off, The choice and master spirits of this age. BRUTUS: O Antony, beg not your death of us! Though now we must appear bloody and cruel, As by our hands and this our present act You see we do, yet see you but our hands And this the bleeding business they have done. Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful; And pity to the general wrong of Rome (As fire drives out fire, so pity pity) Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part, To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony. Our arms in strength of malice, and our hearts Of brothers\\u2019 temper, do receive you in With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence. CASSIUS: Your voice shall be as strong as any man\\u2019s In the disposing of new dignities. BRUTUS: Only be patient till we have appeased The multitude, beside themselves with fear; And then we will deliver you the cause Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him, Have thus proceeded. ANTONY: I doubt not of your wisdom. Let each man render me his bloody hand. First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you.\\u2014 Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand.\\u2014 Now, Decius Brutus, yours;\\u2014now yours, Metellus;\\u2014 Yours, Cinna;\\u2014and, my valiant Casca, yours;\\u2014 Though last, not least in love, yours, good Trebonius.\\u2014 Gentlemen all\\u2014alas, what shall I say? My credit now stands on such slippery ground That one of two bad ways you must conceit me, Either a coward or a flatterer.\\u2014 That I did love thee, Caesar, O, \\u2019tis true! If then thy spirit look upon us now, Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death To see thy Antony making his peace, Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes\\u2014 Most noble!\\u2014in the presence of thy corpse? Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds, Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood, It would become me better than to close In terms of friendship with thine enemies. Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bayed, brave hart, Here didst thou fall, and here thy hunters stand Signed in thy spoil and crimsoned in thy Lethe. O world, thou wast the forest to this hart, And this indeed, O world, the heart of thee. How like a deer strucken by many princes Dost thou here lie! CASSIUS: Mark Antony\\u2014 ANTONY: Pardon me, Caius Cassius. The enemies of Caesar shall say this; Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty. CASSIUS: I blame you not for praising Caesar so. But what compact mean you to have with us? Will you be pricked in number of our friends, Or shall we on and not depend on you? ANTONY: Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed Swayed from the point by looking down on Caesar. Friends am I with you all and love you all, Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous. BRUTUS: Or else were this a savage spectacle. Our reasons are so full of good regard That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar, You should be satisfied.

    "question": "To what extent is Caesar\u2019s downfall a result of his personal flaws versus the anxieties of a changing Roman Republic?",
    "ideal answer": "Caesar\u2019s pride plays a role, but the conspirators act out of fear of tyranny, showing both personal and political causes.",
    "model_answer": {"answer": "Caesar's downfall can be attributed to a combination of both his personal flaws and the anxieties of a changing Roman Republic. Here are some arguments for each:\\n\\n**Personal Flaws:**\\n\\n1. **Hubris**: Caesar's excessive pride and arrogance led him to believe he was above the law and could do as he pleased, disregarding the traditions and institutions of Rome.\\n2. **Lack of humility**: Caesar's failure to acknowledge his own mortality and the power of the gods contributed to his downfall. He became increasingly isolated and paranoid, surrounding himself with sycophants and yes-men who fed his ego.\\n3. **Impulsiveness**: Caesar's impulsive nature led him to make rash decisions, such as crossing the Rubicon River with his legions, which ultimately sealed his fate.\\n\\n**Anxieties of a Changing Roman Republic:**\\n\\n1. **Fear of the mob**: The Roman people were increasingly restless and fearful of the growing power of the plebeians (commoners). Caesar's popularity among the common people made him a target for those who feared his influence.\\n2. **Concerns about the Senate**: The Roman Senate, which had traditionally held power, was concerned about Caesar's growing authority and perceived threat to their dominance.\\n3. **Economic instability**: Rome was facing economic difficulties, including inflation, debt, and a decline in trade. Caesar's policies, such as his land redistribution program, were seen as exacerbating these problems.\\n\\n**Interplay between Personal Flaws and External Pressures:**\\n\\n1. **Caesar's actions fueled the mob's fears**: Caesar's actions, such as his appointment of tribunes and his attempts to reform the Senate, were seen as a threat by those who feared the growing power of the plebeians.\\n2. **The Senate's concerns about Caesar's power**: The Senate's concerns about Caesar's power were fueled by their own personal biases and fears, which were exacerbated by Caesar's actions.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while Caesar's personal flaws, such as his hubris and impulsiveness, contributed to his downfall, the anxieties of a changing Roman Republic also played a significant role. The fear of the mob, concerns about the Senate, and economic instability all created an environment in which Caesar's actions were seen as threatening to the established order. Ultimately, it was the combination of these factors that led to Caesar's assassination.\\n\\n**Shakespeare's portrayal:**\\n\\nIn Shakespeare's play, Caesar's downfall is portrayed as a complex interplay between his personal flaws and the external pressures of the Roman Republic. The play highlights Caesar's hubris and impulsiveness, but also shows how these traits were fueled by the anxieties of the mob and the Senate.\\n\\nThe character of Brutus, who leads the conspiracy against Caesar, is portrayed as a complex figure who is motivated by both noble and selfish reasons. His actions are driven by a desire to protect Rome from Caesar's perceived tyranny, but also by his own personal biases and fears.\\n\\nShakespeare's portrayal of Caesar's downfall serves as a commentary on the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of humility and self-awareness in leadership.", "context": "SOURCE: act-2_scene-2.txt\\nsearch_document:[Keywords: ' t o\\u2019clock, ? servant, a - night, a beast, a crown, a fountain, a heart, a lie, a lioness hath whelp\\u00e8d, a necessary end, a vision, ague, air, all hail, all the wonder, all use, an hour \\u2019s talk, an hundred spout, an offering, another time, antony, arm, asham\\u00e8d, augurer, back, battle, beast, beggar, bid, blood, brutus, caesar, caesar \\u2019s wife, caesar!\\u201d\\u2014who, calphurnia, calphurnia \\u2019s dream, capitol, casca.\\u2014caius ligarius, cause, ceremony, cloud, cognizance, comet, confidence, conquest, conquest stretch mine arm, courtesy, coward, cowardice, crown, danger, day, death, decius, decius brutus, dream, earth, end, enemy, entrail, every, evil, face, fear, fierce fiery warrior, form, fountain, friend, ghost, god, good friend, good morrow, grave, graybeard, great, great man, great rome, greeting, hail, hand, hath, heart, heaven, her knee hath, her sleep, himself, home, horse, hour, house, humor, knee, lie, ligarius, lion, lioness, lord, love, man, many lusty roman, many pipe, mark, mark antony, mighty caesar, mind, morrow, most horrid sight, most mighty caesar, most noble caesar, my back, my dear dear love, my fear, my greeting, my knee, my lord, my love, my robe, my statue, my wife, my will, ne\\u2019er, night, no comet, noise, o caesar, offering, one day, opinion, o\\u2019clock, pain, peace, pipe, portent, prediction, present sacrifice, priest, prince, proceeding, publius, pure blood, rank, reason, relic, right form, robe, roman, rome, sacrifice, satisfaction, scene:2, senate, senator, servant, shame, sight, sleep, so many smile roman, some cause, some wine, someone, spout, squadron, stain, statue, store, street, success, talk, taste, that, that death, that same ague, the air, the augurer, the beast, the capitol, the cause, the cloud, the death, the entrail, the face, the god, the heart, the heaven, the house, the mighty god, the noise, the priest, the senate, the senate house, the senator, the street, the thing, the truth, the valiant, the watch, the world, their death, their hand, their mind, their opinion, themselves, these, these prediction, these thing, they, thing, this, this day, this dream, thrice, thrice hath calphurnia, thy humor, time, tincture, tis, today, tonight, trebonius, truth, two lion, up.\\u2014good, up.\\u2014good morrow, use, valiant, vanish\\u00e8d, very happy time, vision, war, warning, warrior, watch, way, welcome, well dream, what, whelp\\u00e8d, which, whose end, wife, will, wine, wisdom, wonder, word, world, worthy caesar, your enemy, your fear, your good friend, your house, your pain, your private satisfaction, your proceeding bid, your statue spout blood, your wisdom]\\n\\nAct:2 Scene:2 CAESAR: Nor heaven nor Earth have been at peace tonight.

CAESAR: Go bid the priests do present sacrifice, And bring me their opinions of success. SERVANT: I will, my lord. CALPHURNIA: What mean you, Caesar? Think you to walk forth? You shall not stir out of your house today. CAESAR: Caesar shall forth. The things that threatened me Ne\\u2019er looked but on my back. When they shall see The face of Caesar, they are vanish\\u00e8d. CALPHURNIA: Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies, Yet now they fright me. There is one within, Besides the things that we have heard and seen, Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch. A lioness hath whelp\\u00e8d in the streets, And graves have yawned and yielded up their dead. Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds In ranks and squadrons and right form of war, Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol. The noise of battle hurtled in the air, Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan, And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets. O Caesar, these things are beyond all use, And I do fear them. CAESAR: What can be avoided Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods? Yet Caesar shall go forth, for these predictions Are to the world in general as to Caesar. CALPHURNIA: When beggars die there are no comets seen; The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes. CAESAR: Cowards die many times before their deaths; The valiant never taste of death but once. Of all the wonders that I yet have heard, It seems to me most strange that men should fear, Seeing that death, a necessary end, Will come when it will come. SERVANT: What say the augurers? SERVANT: They would not have you to stir forth today. Plucking the entrails of an offering forth, They could not find a heart within the beast. CAESAR: The gods do this in shame of cowardice. Caesar should be a beast without a heart If he should stay at home today for fear. No, Caesar shall not. Danger knows full well That Caesar is more dangerous than he. We are two lions littered in one day, And I the elder and more terrible. And Caesar shall go forth. CALPHURNIA: Alas, my lord, Your wisdom is consumed in confidence. Do not go forth today. Call it my fear That keeps you in the house, and not your own. We\\u2019ll send Mark Antony to the Senate House, And he shall say you are not well today. Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this. CAESAR: Mark Antony shall say I am not well, And for thy humor I will stay at home. DECIUS: Here\\u2019s Decius Brutus; he shall tell them so. Caesar, all hail! Good morrow, worthy Caesar. I come to fetch you to the Senate House. CAESAR: And you are come in very happy time To bear my greeting to the Senators And tell them that I will not come today. Cannot is false, and that I dare not, falser. I will not come today. Tell them so, Decius. CALPHURNIA: Say he is sick. CAESAR: Shall Caesar send a lie? Have I in conquest stretched mine arm so far, To be afeard to tell graybeards the truth? Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come. DECIUS: Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause, Lest I be laughed at when I tell them so. CAESAR: The cause is in my will. I will not come. That is enough to satisfy the Senate. But for your private satisfaction, Because I love you, I will let you know. Calphurnia here, my wife, stays me at home. She dreamt tonight she saw my statue, Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts, Did run pure blood; and many lusty Romans Came smiling and did bathe their hands in it. And these does she apply for warnings and portents And evils imminent, and on her knee Hath begged that I will stay at home today. DECIUS: This dream is all amiss interpreted. It was a vision fair and fortunate. Your statue spouting blood in many pipes, In which so many smiling Romans bathed, Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck Reviving blood, and that great men shall press For tinctures, stains, relics, and cognizance. This by Calphurnia\\u2019s dream is signified. CAESAR: And this way have you well expounded it. DECIUS: I have, when you have heard what I can say. And know it now: the Senate have concluded To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar. If you shall send them word you will not come, Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock Apt to be rendered, for someone to say \\u201cBreak up the Senate till another time, When Caesar\\u2019s wife shall meet with better dreams.\\u201d If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper \\u201cLo, Caesar is afraid\\u201d? Pardon me, Caesar, for my dear dear love To your proceeding bids me tell you this, And reason to my love is liable. CAESAR: How foolish do your fears seem now, Calphurnia! I am asham\\u00e8d I did yield to them. Give me my robe, for I will go. CAESAR: And look where Publius is come to fetch me. PUBLIUS: Good morrow, Caesar. CAESAR: Welcome, Publius.\\u2014 What, Brutus, are you stirred so early too?\\u2014 Good morrow, Casca.\\u2014Caius Ligarius, Caesar was ne\\u2019er so much your enemy As that same ague which hath made you lean.\\u2014 What is \\u2019t o\\u2019clock?

TREBONIUS: Caesar, I will. Aside. And so near will I be That your best friends shall wish I had been further.

When Caesar says \\u201cDo this,\\u201d it is performed. CAESAR: Set on and leave no ceremony out. Sennet. SOOTHSAYER: Caesar. CAESAR: Ha! Who calls? CASCA: Bid every noise be still. Peace, yet again! CAESAR: Who is it in the press that calls on me? I hear a tongue shriller than all the music Cry \\u201cCaesar.\\u201d Speak. Caesar is turned to hear. SOOTHSAYER: Beware the ides of March. CAESAR: What man is that? BRUTUS: A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March. CAESAR: Set him before me. Let me see his face. CASSIUS: Fellow, come from the throng. CASSIUS: Look upon Caesar. CAESAR: What sayst thou to me now? Speak once again. SOOTHSAYER: Beware the ides of March. CAESAR: He is a dreamer. Let us leave him. Pass. CASSIUS: Will you go see the order of the course? BRUTUS: Not I. CASSIUS: I pray you, do. BRUTUS: I am not gamesome. I do lack some part Of that quick spirit that is in Antony. Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires. I\\u2019ll leave you. CASSIUS: Brutus, I do observe you now of late. I have not from your eyes that gentleness And show of love as I was wont to have. You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand Over your friend that loves you. BRUTUS: Cassius, Be not deceived. If I have veiled my look, I turn the trouble of my countenance Merely upon myself. Vex\\u00e8d I am Of late with passions of some difference, Conceptions only proper to myself, Which give some soil, perhaps, to my behaviors. But let not therefore my good friends be grieved (Among which number, Cassius, be you one) Nor construe any further my neglect Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war, Forgets the shows of love to other men. CASSIUS: Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion, By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations. Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face? BRUTUS: No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself But by reflection, by some other things. CASSIUS: \\u2019Tis just. And it is very much lamented, Brutus, That you have no such mirrors as will turn Your hidden worthiness into your eye, That you might see your shadow. I have heard Where many of the best respect in Rome, Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus And groaning underneath this age\\u2019s yoke, Have wished that noble Brutus had his eyes. BRUTUS: Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius, That you would have me seek into myself For that which is not in me? CASSIUS: Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear. And since you know you cannot see yourself So well as by reflection, I, your glass, Will modestly discover to yourself That of yourself which you yet know not of. And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus. Were I a common laughter, or did use To stale with ordinary oaths my love To every new protester; if you know That I do fawn on men and hug them hard And after scandal them, or if you know That I profess myself in banqueting To all the rout, then hold me dangerous. BRUTUS: What means this shouting? I do fear the people Choose Caesar for their king. CASSIUS: Ay, do you fear it? Then must I think you would not have it so. BRUTUS: I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well. But wherefore do you hold me here so long? What is it that you would impart to me? If it be aught toward the general good, Set honor in one eye and death i\\u2019 th\\u2019 other And I will look on both indifferently; For let the gods so speed me as I love The name of honor more than I fear death. CASSIUS: I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus, As well as I do know your outward favor. Well, honor is the subject of my story. I cannot tell what you and other men Think of this life; but, for my single self, I had as lief not be as live to be In awe of such a thing as I myself. I was born free as Caesar; so were you; We both have fed as well, and we can both Endure the winter\\u2019s cold as well as he. For once, upon a raw and gusty day, The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores, Caesar said to me \\u201cDar\\u2019st thou, Cassius, now Leap in with me into this angry flood And swim to yonder point?\\u201d Upon the word, Accoutered as I was, I plung\\u00e8d in And bade him follow; so indeed he did. The torrent roared, and we did buffet it With lusty sinews, throwing it aside And stemming it with hearts of controversy. But ere we could arrive the point proposed, Caesar cried \\u201cHelp me, Cassius, or I sink!\\u201d I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor, Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber Did I the tired Caesar. And this man Is now become a god, and Cassius is A wretched creature and must bend his body If Caesar carelessly but nod on him. He had a fever when he was in Spain, And when the fit was on him, I did mark How he did shake. \\u2019Tis true, this god did shake. His coward lips did from their color fly, And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world Did lose his luster. I did hear him groan. Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans Mark him and write his speeches in their books, \\u201cAlas,\\u201d it cried \\u201cGive me some drink, Titinius\\u201d As a sick girl. You gods, it doth amaze me A man of such a feeble temper should So get the start of the majestic world And bear the palm alone. BRUTUS: Another general shout! I do believe that these applauses are For some new honors that are heaped on Caesar. CASSIUS: Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world Like a Colossus, and we petty men Walk under his huge legs and peep about To find ourselves dishonorable graves. Men at some time are masters of their fates. The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, But in ourselves, that we are underlings. \\u201cBrutus\\u201d and \\u201cCaesar\\u201d\\u2014what should be in that \\u201cCaesar\\u201d? Why should that name be sounded more than yours? Write them together, yours is as fair a name; Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well; Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with \\u2019em, \\u201cBrutus\\u201d will start a spirit as soon as \\u201cCaesar.\\u201d Now, in the names of all the gods at once, Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed! Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods! When went there by an age, since the great flood, But it was famed with more than with one man? When could they say, till now, that talked of Rome, That her wide walks encompassed but one man? Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough When there is in it but one only man. O, you and I have heard our fathers say There was a Brutus once that would have brooked Th\\u2019 eternal devil to keep his state in Rome As easily as a king. BRUTUS: That you do love me, I am nothing jealous. What you would work me to, I have some aim. How I have thought of this, and of these times, I shall recount hereafter. For this present, I would not, so with love I might entreat you, Be any further moved. What you have said I will consider; what you have to say I will with patience hear, and find a time Both meet to hear and answer such high things. Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this: Brutus had rather be a villager Than to repute himself a son of Rome Under these hard conditions as this time Is like to lay upon us. CASSIUS: I am glad that my weak words Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus. BRUTUS: The games are done, and Caesar is returning. CASSIUS: As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve, And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you What hath proceeded worthy note today. BRUTUS: I will do so. But look you, Cassius, The angry spot doth glow on Caesar\\u2019s brow, And all the rest look like a chidden train. Calphurnia\\u2019s cheek is pale, and Cicero Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes As we have seen him in the Capitol, Being crossed in conference by some senators. CASSIUS: Casca will tell us what the matter is. CAESAR: Antonius. ANTONY: Caesar. CAESAR: Let me have men about me that are fat, Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep a-nights. Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look. He thinks too much. Such men are dangerous. ANTONY: Fear him not, Caesar; he\\u2019s not dangerous. He is a noble Roman, and well given. CAESAR: Would he were fatter! But I fear him not. Yet if my name were liable to fear, I do not know the man I should avoid So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much, He is a great observer, and he looks Quite through the deeds of men. He loves no plays, As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music; Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort As if he mocked himself and scorned his spirit That could be moved to smile at anything. Such men as he be never at heart\\u2019s ease Whiles they behold a greater than themselves, And therefore are they very dangerous. I rather tell thee what is to be feared Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar. Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf, And tell me truly what thou think\\u2019st of him. CASCA: You pulled me by the cloak. Would you speak with me? BRUTUS: Ay, Casca. Tell us what hath chanced today That Caesar looks so sad. CASCA: Why, you were with him, were you not? BRUTUS: I should not then ask Casca what had chanced. CASCA: Why, there was a crown offered him; and, being offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand, thus, and then the people fell a-shouting. BRUTUS: What was the second noise for? CASCA: Why, for that too. CASSIUS: They shouted thrice. What was the last cry for? CASCA: Why, for that too. BRUTUS: Was the crown offered him thrice? CASCA: Ay, marry, was \\u2019t, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler than other; and at every putting-by, mine honest neighbors shouted. CASSIUS: Who offered him the crown? CASCA: Why, Antony. BRUTUS: Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.\\n\\n---\\n\\nSOURCE: act-3_scene-1.txt\\nAct:3 Scene:1 CAESAR: The ides of March are come. SOOTHSAYER: Ay, Caesar, but not gone. ARTEMIDORUS: Hail, Caesar. Read this schedule. DECIUS: Trebonius doth desire you to o\\u2019erread, At your best leisure, this his humble suit. ARTEMIDORUS: O Caesar, read mine first, for mine\\u2019s a suit That touches Caesar nearer. Read it, great Caesar. CAESAR: What touches us ourself shall be last served. ARTEMIDORUS: Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly. CAESAR: What, is the fellow mad? PUBLIUS: Sirrah, give place. CASSIUS: What, urge you your petitions in the street? Come to the Capitol. POPILIUS: I wish your enterprise today may thrive. CASSIUS: What enterprise, Popilius? POPILIUS: Fare you well. BRUTUS: What said Popilius Lena? CASSIUS: He wished today our enterprise might thrive. I fear our purpose is discover\\u00e8d. BRUTUS: Look how he makes to Caesar. Mark him. CASSIUS: Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.\\u2014 Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known, Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back, For I will slay myself. BRUTUS: Cassius, be constant. Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes, For look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change. CASSIUS: Trebonius knows his time, for look you, Brutus, He draws Mark Antony out of the way. DECIUS: Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go And presently prefer his suit to Caesar. BRUTUS: He is addressed. Press near and second him. CINNA: Casca, you are the first that rears your hand. CAESAR: Are we all ready? What is now amiss That Caesar and his Senate must redress? METELLUS: Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar, Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat An humble heart. CAESAR: I must prevent thee, Cimber. These couchings and these lowly courtesies Might fire the blood of ordinary men And turn preordinance and first decree Into the law of children. Be not fond To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood That will be thawed from the true quality With that which melteth fools\\u2014I mean sweet words, Low-crook\\u00e8d curtsies, and base spaniel fawning. Thy brother by decree is banish\\u00e8d. If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him, I spurn thee like a cur out of my way. Know: Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause Will he be satisfied. METELLUS: Is there no voice more worthy than my own To sound more sweetly in great Caesar\\u2019s ear For the repealing of my banished brother? BRUTUS: I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar, Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may Have an immediate freedom of repeal. CAESAR: What, Brutus? CASSIUS: Pardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon! As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber. CAESAR: I could be well moved, if I were as you. If I could pray to move, prayers would move me. But I am constant as the Northern Star, Of whose true fixed and resting quality There is no fellow in the firmament. The skies are painted with unnumbered sparks; They are all fire, and every one doth shine. But there\\u2019s but one in all doth hold his place. So in the world: \\u2019tis furnished well with men, And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive. Yet in the number I do know but one That unassailable holds on his rank, Unshaked of motion; and that I am he Let me a little show it, even in this: That I was constant Cimber should be banished And constant do remain to keep him so. CINNA: O Caesar\\u2014 CAESAR: Hence. Wilt thou lift up Olympus? DECIUS: Great Caesar\\u2014 CAESAR: Doth not Brutus bootless kneel? CASCA: Speak, hands, for me! CAESAR: Et tu, Brut\\u00e8?\\u2014Then fall, Caesar. CINNA: Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead! Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets. CASSIUS: Some to the common pulpits and cry out \\u201cLiberty, freedom, and enfranchisement.\\u201d BRUTUS: People and Senators, be not affrighted. Fly not; stand still. Ambition\\u2019s debt is paid. CASCA: Go to the pulpit, Brutus. DECIUS: And Cassius too. BRUTUS: Where\\u2019s Publius? CINNA: Here, quite confounded with this mutiny. METELLUS: Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar\\u2019s Should chance\\u2014 BRUTUS: Talk not of standing.\\u2014Publius, good cheer. There is no harm intended to your person, Nor to no Roman else. So tell them, Publius. CASSIUS: And leave us, Publius, lest that the people, Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief. BRUTUS: Do so, and let no man abide this deed But we the doers. CASSIUS: Where is Antony? TREBONIUS: Fled to his house amazed. Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run As it were doomsday. BRUTUS: Fates, we will know your pleasures. That we shall die we know; \\u2019tis but the time, And drawing days out, that men stand upon. CASCA: Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life Cuts off so many years of fearing death. BRUTUS: Grant that, and then is death a benefit. So are we Caesar\\u2019s friends, that have abridged His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop, And let us bathe our hands in Caesar\\u2019s blood Up to the elbows and besmear our swords. Then walk we forth, even to the marketplace, And, waving our red weapons o\\u2019er our heads, Let\\u2019s all cry \\u201cPeace, freedom, and liberty!\\u201d CASSIUS: Stoop then, and wash. How many ages hence Shall this our lofty scene be acted over In states unborn and accents yet unknown! BRUTUS: How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport, That now on Pompey\\u2019s basis lies along No worthier than the dust! CASSIUS: So oft as that shall be, So often shall the knot of us be called The men that gave their country liberty. DECIUS: What, shall we forth? CASSIUS: Ay, every man away. Brutus shall lead, and we will grace his heels With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome. BRUTUS: Soft, who comes here? A friend of Antony\\u2019s. SERVANT: Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel. Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down, And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say: Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest; Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving. Say, I love Brutus, and I honor him; Say, I feared Caesar, honored him, and loved him. If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony May safely come to him and be resolved How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death, Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead So well as Brutus living, but will follow The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus Thorough the hazards of this untrod state With all true faith. So says my master Antony. BRUTUS: Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman. I never thought him worse. Tell him, so please him come unto this place, He shall be satisfied and, by my honor, Depart untouched. SERVANT: I\\u2019ll fetch him presently. BRUTUS: I know that we shall have him well to friend. CASSIUS: I wish we may; but yet have I a mind That fears him much, and my misgiving still Falls shrewdly to the purpose. BRUTUS: But here comes Antony.\\u2014Welcome, Mark Antony! ANTONY: O mighty Caesar, dost thou lie so low? Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.\\u2014 I know not, gentlemen, what you intend, Who else must be let blood, who else is rank. If I myself, there is no hour so fit As Caesar\\u2019s death\\u2019s hour, nor no instrument Of half that worth as those your swords made rich With the most noble blood of all this world. I do beseech you, if you bear me hard, Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke, Fulfill your pleasure. Live a thousand years, I shall not find myself so apt to die; No place will please me so, no mean of death, As here by Caesar, and by you cut off, The choice and master spirits of this age. BRUTUS: O Antony, beg not your death of us! Though now we must appear bloody and cruel, As by our hands and this our present act You see we do, yet see you but our hands And this the bleeding business they have done. Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful; And pity to the general wrong of Rome (As fire drives out fire, so pity pity) Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part, To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony. Our arms in strength of malice, and our hearts Of brothers\\u2019 temper, do receive you in With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence. CASSIUS: Your voice shall be as strong as any man\\u2019s In the disposing of new dignities. BRUTUS: Only be patient till we have appeased The multitude, beside themselves with fear; And then we will deliver you the cause Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him, Have thus proceeded. ANTONY: I doubt not of your wisdom. Let each man render me his bloody hand. First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you.\\u2014 Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand.\\u2014 Now, Decius Brutus, yours;\\u2014now yours, Metellus;\\u2014 Yours, Cinna;\\u2014and, my valiant Casca, yours;\\u2014 Though last, not least in love, yours, good Trebonius.\\u2014 Gentlemen all\\u2014alas, what shall I say? My credit now stands on such slippery ground That one of two bad ways you must conceit me, Either a coward or a flatterer.\\u2014 That I did love thee, Caesar, O, \\u2019tis true!

But what compact mean you to have with us? Will you be pricked in number of our friends, Or shall we on and not depend on you? ANTONY: Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed Swayed from the point by looking down on Caesar. Friends am I with you all and love you all, Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous. BRUTUS: Or else were this a savage spectacle. Our reasons are so full of good regard That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar, You should be satisfied. ANTONY: That\\u2019s all I seek; And am, moreover, suitor that I may Produce his body to the marketplace, And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend, Speak in the order of his funeral. BRUTUS: You shall, Mark Antony. CASSIUS: Brutus, a word with you. CASSIUS: You know not what you do. Do not consent That Antony speak in his funeral. Know you how much the people may be moved By that which he will utter? BRUTUS: By your pardon, I will myself into the pulpit first And show the reason of our Caesar\\u2019s death. What Antony shall speak I will protest He speaks by leave and by permission, And that we are contented Caesar shall Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies. It shall advantage more than do us wrong. CASSIUS: I know not what may fall. I like it not."}

    "question": "Discuss how public perception and mob mentality drive political power in the play.",
    "ideal answer": "The crowd is easily swayed by speeches, showing how political power comes from manipulating public emotion.",
    "model_answer": {"answer": "In Julius Caesar, Shakespeare masterfully illustrates how public perception and mob mentality can significantly influence political power. The tragic events that unfold demonstrate how a collective frenzy can be harnessed to overthrow a leader.\\n\\nWhen Brutus and Cassius conspire against Caesar, they initially aim to protect the Roman Republic from his perceived tyranny (Act 2 Scene 3: 'There is but one mind in all these men, / And it is bent against Caesar'). However, as the play progresses, their actions are driven by a mob mentality, fueled by fear, misinformation, and emotional manipulation. The crowd's fervor for revenge against Caesar grows, ultimately leading to his assassination.\\n\\nThe mob's influence on politics is also evident in how Antony uses public perception to turn the citizens of Rome against Brutus and Cassius. His masterful oration at Caesar's funeral (Act 3 Scene 2) skillfully manipulates the crowd's emotions, transforming them from loyal supporters of Brutus into bitter enemies.\\n\\nThe play highlights how mob mentality can be a powerful force in politics, as seen in the following lines: 'Rome itself is lost when any man doth lose the sense of his identity' (Act 3 Scene 2). This quote underscores the idea that when individuals lose sight of their own values and identities, they become susceptible to the whims of the crowd.\\n\\nFurthermore, Shakespeare portrays how public perception can be shaped by charismatic leaders. Antony's ability to inspire loyalty and devotion in the Roman people is a stark contrast to Brutus' inability to connect with his audience (Act 3 Scene 2: 'O, ye gods! / Why have you thus besmirched my name?'). This dichotomy highlights the importance of effective communication and emotional manipulation in politics.\\n\\nUltimately, Julius Caesar demonstrates how public perception and mob mentality can be harnessed to drive political power. The play serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked emotions and the importance of critical thinking in leadership.", "context": "SOURCE: act-5_scene-2.txt\\nsearch_document:[Keywords: act:5 scene:2 brutus, bill, brutus, demeanor, legion, messala, octavius, octavius ' wing, overthrow, push, side, sudden push, the legion, the other side, the overthrow, these bill, they, wing]\\n\\nAct:5 Scene:2 BRUTUS: Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills Unto the legions on the other side!

What is the difference? Many ordinary readers assume that there is a single text for the plays: what Shakespeare wrote. But Shakespeare\\u2019s plays were not published the way modern novels or plays are published today: as a single, authoritative text. In some cases, the plays have come down to us in multiple published versions, represented by various Quartos (Qq) and by the great collection put together by his colleagues in 1623, called the First Folio (F). There are, for example, three very different versions of Hamlet, two of King Lear, Henry V, Romeo and Juliet, and others. Editors choose which version to use as their base text, and then amend that text with words, lines or speech prefixes from the other versions that, in their judgment, make for a better or more accurate text. Other editorial decisions involve choices about whether an unfamiliar word could be understood in light of other writings of the period or whether it should be changed; decisions about words that made it into Shakespeare\\u2019s text by accident through four hundred years of printings and misprinting; and even decisions based on cultural preference and taste. When the Moby\\u2122 Text was created, for example, it was deemed \\u201cimproper\\u201d and \\u201cindecent\\u201d for Miranda to chastise Caliban for having attempted to rape her. (See The Tempest, 1.2: \\u201cAbhorred slave,/Which any print of goodness wilt not take,/Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee\\u2026\\u201d). All Shakespeare editors at the time took the speech away from her and gave it to her father, Prospero. The editors of the Moby\\u2122 Shakespeare produced their text long before scholars fully understood the proper grounds on which to make the thousands of decisions that Shakespeare editors face. The Folger Library Shakespeare Editions, on which the Folger Digital Texts depend, make this editorial process as nearly transparent as is possible, in contrast to older texts, like the Moby\\u2122, which hide editorial interventions. The reader of the Folger Shakespeare knows where the text has been altered because editorial interventions are signaled by square brackets (for example, from Othello: \\u201c If she in chains of magic were not bound, \\u201d), half-square brackets (for example, from Henry V: \\u201cWith blood and sword and fire to win your p , y y right,\\u201d), or angle brackets (for example, from Hamlet: \\u201cO farewell, honest soldier. Who hath relieved/you?\\u201d). At any point in the text, you can hover your cursor over a bracket for more information. Because the Folger Digital Texts are edited in accord with twenty-first century knowledge about Shakespeare\\u2019s texts, the Folger here provides them to readers, scholars, teachers, actors, directors, and students, free of charge, confident of their quality as texts of the plays and pleased to be able to make this contribution to the study and enjoyment of Shakespeare. Synopsis Caesar\\u2019s assassination is just the halfway point of Julius Caesar. The first part of the play leads to his death; the second portrays the consequences. As the action begins, Rome prepares for Caesar\\u2019s triumphal entrance. Brutus, Caesar\\u2019s friend and ally, fears that Caesar will become king, destroying the republic. Cassius and others convince Brutus to join a conspiracy to kill Caesar. On the day of the assassination, Caesar plans to stay home at the urging of his wife, Calphurnia. A conspirator, Decius Brutus, persuades him to go to the Senate with the other conspirators and his friend, Mark Antony. At the Senate, the conspirators stab Caesar to death. Antony uses a funeral oration to turn the citizens of Rome against them. Brutus and Cassius escape as Antony joins forces with Octavius Caesar. Encamped with their armies, Brutus and Cassius quarrel, then agree to march on Antony and Octavius. In the battle which follows, Cassius, misled by erroneous reports of loss, persuades a slave to kill him; Brutus\\u2019s army is defeated. Brutus commits suicide, praised by Antony as \\u201cthe noblest Roman of them all.\\u201d Title: Julius Caesar Author: William Shakespeare Release date: November 1, 1998 [eBook #1522] Most recently updated: September 19, 2025 Language: English Credits: the PG Shakespeare Team, a team of about twenty Project Gutenberg volunteers *** START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK JULIUS CAESAR *** THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR by William Shakespeare Contents ACT-I Scene-I.

    "question": "How does the play explore the idea of \u201cnoble betrayal\u201d? Is Brutus justified in killing Caesar?",
    "ideal answer": "Brutus believes killing Caesar saves Rome, making it morally justified in his eyes, though its outcome proves tragic.",
    "model_answer": {"answer": "The concept of 'noble betrayal' is a central theme in William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, and its exploration raises complex questions about morality, loyalty, and the nature of leadership. The play presents a nuanced portrayal of Brutus' decision to kill Caesar, highlighting both the motivations behind his actions and the consequences that follow.\\n\\nBrutus, a member of Caesar's inner circle, is driven by a desire to protect Rome from what he perceives as Caesar's growing tyranny and potential threat to the republic. He believes that Caesar's ambition and desire for power will lead him to undermine the Roman Senate and establish a monarchy. Brutus' betrayal is motivated by a sense of patriotism and a commitment to preserving the values of the Roman Republic.\\n\\nHowever, the play also raises questions about the morality of Brutus' actions. While his intentions may be noble, his method of killing Caesar is brutal and violent. The assassination itself is portrayed as a chaotic and bloody event, with multiple conspirators involved and conflicting emotions expressed by each character.\\n\\nThe exploration of 'noble betrayal' in Julius Caesar can be seen through several key aspects:\\n\\n1.  **Motivation**: Brutus' motivation for killing Caesar is rooted in his belief that Caesar poses a threat to the Roman Republic. This motivation is driven by a sense of patriotism and a desire to protect Rome from tyranny.\\n\\n2.  **Consequences**: The consequences of Brutus' actions are far-reaching and devastating. Caesar's death leads to a power vacuum, which ultimately results in the rise of Antony and Octavius, two men who will go on to become powerful leaders in their own right.\\n\\n3.  **Morality**: The play raises questions about the morality of Brutus' actions. While his intentions may be noble, his method of killing Caesar is brutal and violent. This moral ambiguity adds complexity to the play's exploration of 'noble betrayal.'\\n\\n4.  **Characterization**: The characterization of Brutus in the play is multifaceted. He is portrayed as a complex figure with both admirable and flawed qualities. His decision to kill Caesar is driven by a sense of patriotism, but it also reveals his own personal flaws and weaknesses.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Julius Caesar presents a nuanced exploration of 'noble betrayal' through its portrayal of Brutus' decision to kill Caesar.

PLEBEIANS: We\\u2019ll hear him.\\u2014Noble Antony, go up. ANTONY: For Brutus\\u2019 sake, I am beholding to you. FOURTH PLEBEIAN: What does he say of Brutus? THIRD PLEBEIAN: He says for Brutus\\u2019 sake He finds himself beholding to us all. FOURTH PLEBEIAN: \\u2019Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here. FIRST PLEBEIAN: This Caesar was a tyrant. THIRD PLEBEIAN: Nay, that\\u2019s certain. We are blest that Rome is rid of him. SECOND PLEBEIAN: Peace, let us hear what Antony can say. ANTONY: You gentle Romans\\u2014 PLEBEIANS: Peace, ho! Let us hear him. ANTONY: Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears. I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. The evil that men do lives after them; The good is oft interr\\u00e8d with their bones. So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus Hath told you Caesar was ambitious. If it were so, it was a grievous fault, And grievously hath Caesar answered it. Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest (For Brutus is an honorable man; So are they all, all honorable men), Come I to speak in Caesar\\u2019s funeral. He was my friend, faithful and just to me, But Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man. He hath brought many captives home to Rome, Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill. Did this in Caesar seem ambitious? When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept; Ambition should be made of sterner stuff. Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man. You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown, Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And sure he is an honorable man. I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, But here I am to speak what I do know. You all did love him once, not without cause. What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for him?\\u2014 O judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, And men have lost their reason!\\u2014Bear with me; My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar, And I must pause till it come back to me. FIRST PLEBEIAN: Methinks there is much reason in his sayings. SECOND PLEBEIAN: If thou consider rightly of the matter, Caesar has had great wrong. THIRD PLEBEIAN: Has he, masters? I fear there will a worse come in his place. FOURTH PLEBEIAN: Marked you his words? He would not take the crown; Therefore \\u2019tis certain he was not ambitious. FIRST PLEBEIAN: If it be found so, some will dear abide it. SECOND PLEBEIAN: Poor soul, his eyes are red as fire with weeping. THIRD PLEBEIAN: There\\u2019s not a nobler man in Rome than Antony. FOURTH PLEBEIAN: Now mark him. He begins again to speak. ANTONY: But yesterday the word of Caesar might Have stood against the world. Now lies he there, And none so poor to do him reverence. O masters, if I were disposed to stir Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage, I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong, Who, you all know, are honorable men. I will not do them wrong. I rather choose To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you, Than I will wrong such honorable men. But here\\u2019s a parchment with the seal of Caesar. I found it in his closet. \\u2019Tis his will. Let but the commons hear this testament, Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read, And they would go and kiss dead Caesar\\u2019s wounds And dip their napkins in his sacred blood\\u2014 Yea, beg a hair of him for memory And, dying, mention it within their wills, Bequeathing it as a rich legacy Unto their issue. FOURTH PLEBEIAN: We\\u2019ll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony. PLEBEIANS: The will, the will! We will hear Caesar\\u2019s will. ANTONY: Have patience, gentle friends. I must not read it. It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you. You are not wood, you are not stones, but men. And, being men, hearing the will of Caesar, It will inflame you; it will make you mad. \\u2019Tis good you know not that you are his heirs, For if you should, O, what would come of it? FOURTH PLEBEIAN: Read the will! We\\u2019ll hear it, Antony. PLEBEIANS: You shall read us the will, Caesar\\u2019s will. ANTONY: Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile? I have o\\u2019ershot myself to tell you of it. I fear I wrong the honorable men Whose daggers have stabbed Caesar. I do fear it. FOURTH PLEBEIAN: They were traitors. Honorable men? PLEBEIANS: The will! The testament! SECOND PLEBEIAN: They were villains, murderers. The will! Read the will. ANTONY: You will compel me, then, to read the will? Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar, And let me show you him that made the will. Shall I descend? And will you give me leave? PLEBEIANS: Come down. SECOND PLEBEIAN: Descend. THIRD PLEBEIAN: You shall have leave. FOURTH PLEBEIAN: A ring; stand round. FIRST PLEBEIAN: Stand from the hearse. Stand from the body. SECOND PLEBEIAN: Room for Antony, most noble Antony. ANTONY: Nay, press not so upon me. Stand far off. PLEBEIANS: Stand back! Room! Bear back! ANTONY: If you have tears, prepare to shed them now. You all do know this mantle. I remember The first time ever Caesar put it on. \\u2019Twas on a summer\\u2019s evening in his tent, That day he overcame the Nervii. Look, in this place ran Cassius\\u2019 dagger through. See what a rent the envious Casca made. Through this the well-belov\\u00e8d Brutus stabbed, And, as he plucked his curs\\u00e8d steel away, Mark how the blood of Caesar followed it, As rushing out of doors to be resolved If Brutus so unkindly knocked or no; For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar\\u2019s angel. Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him! This was the most unkindest cut of all. For when the noble Caesar saw him stab, Ingratitude, more strong than traitors\\u2019 arms, Quite vanquished him. Then burst his mighty heart, And, in his mantle muffling up his face, Even at the base of Pompey\\u2019s statue (Which all the while ran blood) great Caesar fell. O, what a fall was there, my countrymen! Then I and you and all of us fell down, Whilst bloody treason flourished over us. O, now you weep, and I perceive you feel The dint of pity. These are gracious drops. Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold Here is himself, marred as you see with traitors. FIRST PLEBEIAN: O piteous spectacle! SECOND PLEBEIAN: O noble Caesar! THIRD PLEBEIAN: O woeful day! FOURTH PLEBEIAN: O traitors, villains! FIRST PLEBEIAN: O most bloody sight! SECOND PLEBEIAN: We will be revenged. PLEBEIANS: Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay! Let not a traitor live! ANTONY: Stay, countrymen. FIRST PLEBEIAN: Peace there! Hear the noble Antony. SECOND PLEBEIAN: We\\u2019ll hear him, we\\u2019ll follow him, we\\u2019ll die with him. ANTONY: Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up To such a sudden flood of mutiny. They that have done this deed are honorable. What private griefs they have, alas, I know not, That made them do it. They are wise and honorable And will no doubt with reasons answer you. I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts. I am no orator, as Brutus is, But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man That love my friend, and that they know full well That gave me public leave to speak of him. For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth, Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech To stir men\\u2019s blood. I only speak right on. I tell you that which you yourselves do know, Show you sweet Caesar\\u2019s wounds, poor poor dumb mouths, And bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus, And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue In every wound of Caesar that should move The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny. PLEBEIANS: We\\u2019ll mutiny. FIRST PLEBEIAN: We\\u2019ll burn the house of Brutus. THIRD PLEBEIAN: Away then. Come, seek the conspirators. ANTONY: Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak. PLEBEIANS: Peace, ho! Hear Antony, most noble Antony! ANTONY: Why, friends, you go to do you know not what. Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves? Alas, you know not. I must tell you then.

DECIUS: Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go And presently prefer his suit to Caesar. BRUTUS: He is addressed. Press near and second him. CINNA: Casca, you are the first that rears your hand. CAESAR: Are we all ready? What is now amiss That Caesar and his Senate must redress? METELLUS: Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar, Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat An humble heart. CAESAR: I must prevent thee, Cimber. These couchings and these lowly courtesies Might fire the blood of ordinary men And turn preordinance and first decree Into the law of children. Be not fond To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood That will be thawed from the true quality With that which melteth fools\\u2014I mean sweet words, Low-crook\\u00e8d curtsies, and base spaniel fawning. Thy brother by decree is banish\\u00e8d. If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him, I spurn thee like a cur out of my way. Know: Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause Will he be satisfied. METELLUS: Is there no voice more worthy than my own To sound more sweetly in great Caesar\\u2019s ear For the repealing of my banished brother? BRUTUS: I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar, Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may Have an immediate freedom of repeal. CAESAR: What, Brutus? CASSIUS: Pardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon! As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber. CAESAR: I could be well moved, if I were as you. If I could pray to move, prayers would move me. But I am constant as the Northern Star, Of whose true fixed and resting quality There is no fellow in the firmament. The skies are painted with unnumbered sparks; They are all fire, and every one doth shine. But there\\u2019s but one in all doth hold his place. So in the world: \\u2019tis furnished well with men, And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive. Yet in the number I do know but one That unassailable holds on his rank, Unshaked of motion; and that I am he Let me a little show it, even in this: That I was constant Cimber should be banished And constant do remain to keep him so. CINNA: O Caesar\\u2014 CAESAR: Hence. Wilt thou lift up Olympus? DECIUS: Great Caesar\\u2014 CAESAR: Doth not Brutus bootless kneel? CASCA: Speak, hands, for me! CAESAR: Et tu, Brut\\u00e8?\\u2014Then fall, Caesar. CINNA: Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead! Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets. CASSIUS: Some to the common pulpits and cry out \\u201cLiberty, freedom, and enfranchisement.\\u201d BRUTUS: People and Senators, be not affrighted. Fly not; stand still. Ambition\\u2019s debt is paid. CASCA: Go to the pulpit, Brutus. DECIUS: And Cassius too. BRUTUS: Where\\u2019s Publius? CINNA: Here, quite confounded with this mutiny. METELLUS: Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar\\u2019s Should chance\\u2014 BRUTUS: Talk not of standing.\\u2014Publius, good cheer. There is no harm intended to your person, Nor to no Roman else. So tell them, Publius. CASSIUS: And leave us, Publius, lest that the people, Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief. BRUTUS: Do so, and let no man abide this deed But we the doers. CASSIUS: Where is Antony? TREBONIUS: Fled to his house amazed. Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run As it were doomsday. BRUTUS: Fates, we will know your pleasures. That we shall die we know; \\u2019tis but the time, And drawing days out, that men stand upon. CASCA: Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life Cuts off so many years of fearing death. BRUTUS: Grant that, and then is death a benefit. So are we Caesar\\u2019s friends, that have abridged His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop, And let us bathe our hands in Caesar\\u2019s blood Up to the elbows and besmear our swords. Then walk we forth, even to the marketplace, And, waving our red weapons o\\u2019er our heads, Let\\u2019s all cry \\u201cPeace, freedom, and liberty!\\u201d CASSIUS: Stoop then, and wash. How many ages hence Shall this our lofty scene be acted over In states unborn and accents yet unknown! BRUTUS: How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport, That now on Pompey\\u2019s basis lies along No worthier than the dust! CASSIUS: So oft as that shall be, So often shall the knot of us be called The men that gave their country liberty. DECIUS: What, shall we forth? CASSIUS: Ay, every man away. Brutus shall lead, and we will grace his heels With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome. BRUTUS: Soft, who comes here? A friend of Antony\\u2019s. SERVANT: Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel. Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down, And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say: Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest; Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving. Say, I love Brutus, and I honor him; Say, I feared Caesar, honored him, and loved him. If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony May safely come to him and be resolved How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death, Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead So well as Brutus living, but will follow The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus Thorough the hazards of this untrod state With all true faith. So says my master Antony. BRUTUS: Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman. I never thought him worse. Tell him, so please him come unto this place, He shall be satisfied and, by my honor, Depart untouched. SERVANT: I\\u2019ll fetch him presently. BRUTUS: I know that we shall have him well to friend. CASSIUS: I wish we may; but yet have I a mind That fears him much, and my misgiving still Falls shrewdly to the purpose. BRUTUS: But here comes Antony.\\u2014Welcome, Mark Antony! ANTONY: O mighty Caesar, dost thou lie so low? Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.\\u2014 I know not, gentlemen, what you intend, Who else must be let blood, who else is rank. If I myself, there is no hour so fit As Caesar\\u2019s death\\u2019s hour, nor no instrument Of half that worth as those your swords made rich With the most noble blood of all this world. I do beseech you, if you bear me hard, Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke, Fulfill your pleasure. Live a thousand years, I shall not find myself so apt to die; No place will please me so, no mean of death, As here by Caesar, and by you cut off, The choice and master spirits of this age. BRUTUS: O Antony, beg not your death of us! Though now we must appear bloody and cruel, As by our hands and this our present act You see we do, yet see you but our hands And this the bleeding business they have done. Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful; And pity to the general wrong of Rome (As fire drives out fire, so pity pity) Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part, To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony. Our arms in strength of malice, and our hearts Of brothers\\u2019 temper, do receive you in With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence. CASSIUS: Your voice shall be as strong as any man\\u2019s In the disposing of new dignities. BRUTUS: Only be patient till we have appeased The multitude, beside themselves with fear; And then we will deliver you the cause Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him, Have thus proceeded. ANTONY: I doubt not of your wisdom. Let each man render me his bloody hand. First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you.\\u2014 Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand.\\u2014 Now, Decius Brutus, yours;\\u2014now yours, Metellus;\\u2014 Yours, Cinna;\\u2014and, my valiant Casca, yours;\\u2014 Though last, not least in love, yours, good Trebonius.\\u2014 Gentlemen all\\u2014alas, what shall I say? My credit now stands on such slippery ground That one of two bad ways you must conceit me, Either a coward or a flatterer.\\u2014 That I did love thee, Caesar, O, \\u2019tis true! If then thy spirit look upon us now, Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death To see thy Antony making his peace, Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes\\u2014 Most noble!\\u2014in the presence of thy corpse? Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds, Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood, It would become me better than to close In terms of friendship with thine enemies. Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bayed, brave hart, Here didst thou fall, and here thy hunters stand Signed in thy spoil and crimsoned in thy Lethe. O world, thou wast the forest to this hart, And this indeed, O world, the heart of thee. How like a deer strucken by many princes Dost thou here lie! CASSIUS: Mark Antony\\u2014 ANTONY: Pardon me, Caius Cassius. The enemies of Caesar shall say this; Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty. CASSIUS: I blame you not for praising Caesar so. But what compact mean you to have with us? Will you be pricked in number of our friends, Or shall we on and not depend on you? ANTONY: Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed Swayed from the point by looking down on Caesar. Friends am I with you all and love you all, Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous. BRUTUS: Or else were this a savage spectacle. Our reasons are so full of good regard That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar, You should be satisfied. ANTONY: That\\u2019s all I seek; And am, moreover, suitor that I may Produce his body to the marketplace, And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend, Speak in the order of his funeral. BRUTUS: You shall, Mark Antony. CASSIUS: Brutus, a word with you. CASSIUS: You know not what you do. Do not consent That Antony speak in his funeral. Know you how much the people may be moved By that which he will utter? BRUTUS: By your pardon, I will myself into the pulpit first And show the reason of our Caesar\\u2019s death. What Antony shall speak I will protest He speaks by leave and by permission, And that we are contented Caesar shall Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies. It shall advantage more than do us wrong. CASSIUS: I know not what may fall. I like it not."}

He seeks to maintain dignity and decorum during Caesar's funeral, even if it means suppressing his own emotions.\\n\\nIn contrast, Antony, a master of emotional expression, is driven by passion and oratory skill.
