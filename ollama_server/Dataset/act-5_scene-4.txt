Act:5 
Scene:4 

BRUTUS: Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!
CATO: What bastard doth not? Who will go with me? I will proclaim my name about the field. I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho! A foe to tyrants and my country’s friend. I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!
LUCILIUS: And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I! Brutus, my country’s friend! Know me for Brutus. O young and noble Cato, art thou down? Why, now thou diest as bravely as Titinius And mayst be honored, being Cato’s son.
FIRST SOLDIER: Yield, or thou diest.
LUCILIUS: Only I yield to die. There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight. Kill Brutus and be honored in his death.
FIRST SOLDIER: We must not. A noble prisoner!
SECOND SOLDIER: Room, ho! Tell Antony Brutus is ta’en.
FIRST SOLDIER: I’ll tell the news. Here comes the General.— Brutus is ta’en, Brutus is ta’en, my lord.
ANTONY: Where is he?
LUCILIUS: Safe, Antony, Brutus is safe enough. I dare assure thee that no enemy Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus. The gods defend him from so great a shame! When you do find him, or alive or dead, He will be found like Brutus, like himself.
ANTONY: This is not Brutus, friend, but I assure you, A prize no less in worth. Keep this man safe. Give him all kindness. I had rather have Such men my friends than enemies. Go on, And see whe’er Brutus be alive or dead, And bring us word unto Octavius’ tent How everything is chanced.
